fayre is my love , when her fayre golden haires <eol> with the loose wynd ye waving chance to marke <eol> fayre , when the rose in her red cheekes appeares <eol> or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke <eol> fayre , when her brest , lyke a rich laden barke <eol> with pretious merchandize she forth doth lay <eol> fayre , when that cloud of pryde , which oft doth dark <eol> her goodly light , with smiles she drives away <eol> but fayrest she , when so she doth display <eol> the gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight <eol> throgh which her words so wise do make their way <eol> to beare the message of her gentle spright <eol> the rest be works of natures wonderment <eol> but this the worke of harts astonishment <eol>
