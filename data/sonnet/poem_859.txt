slow toiling upward from â€™ the misty vale <eol> i leave the bright enamelled zones below <eol> no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow <eol> their lingering sweetness load the morning gale <eol> few are the slender flowerets , scentless , pale <eol> that on their ice clad stems all trembling blow <eol> along the margin of unmelting snow <eol> yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail <eol> white realm of peace above the flowering line <eol> welcome thy frozen domes , thy rocky spires <eol> o'er thee undimmed the moon girt planets shine <eol> on thy majestic altars fade the fires <eol> that filled the air with smoke of vain desires <eol> and all the unclouded blue of heaven is thine <eol>
