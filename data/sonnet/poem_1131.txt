like as the spotless ermelin distressed <eol> circumpassed round with filth and lothsome mud <eol> pines in her grief , imprisoned to her nest <eol> and cannot issue forth to seek her good <eol> so i invironed with a hatefull want <eol> look to the heavens ; the heavens yield forth no grace <eol> i search the earth , the earth i find as scant <eol> i view myself , myself in wofull case <eol> heaven nor earth will not , myself cannot make <eol> a way through want to free my soul from care <eol> but i must pine , and in my pining lurk <eol> lest my sad looks bewray me how i fare <eol> my fortune mantled with a cloud s'obscure <eol> thus shades my life so long as wants endure <eol>
