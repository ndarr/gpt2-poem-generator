so is it with this singing art of ours <eol> that once with maids went maidenlike , and played <eol> with woven dances in the poplar shade <eol> and all her song was but of lady 's bowers <eol> and the returning swallows , and spring flowers <eol> till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed <eol> a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed <eol> her singing chaplet with the snow and showers <eol> yea , fair well water for the bitter brine <eol> she left , and by the margin of life 's sea <eol> sings , and her song is full of the sea 's moan <eol> and wild with dread , and love of proserpine <eol> and whoso once has listened to her , he <eol> his whole life long is slave to her alone <eol>
