of old i wandered by the river 's side <eol> between whose banks the mighty waters glide <eol> where vast niagara , hurrying to its fall <eol> builds and unbuilds its ever tumbling wall <eol> oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar <eol> of battling floods , and feel the trembling shore <eol> as the huge torrent , girded for its leap <eol> with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep <eol> not less distinct , from memory 's pictured urn <eol> the gray old rock , the leafy woods , return <eol> robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear <eol> and once again with quickened sense i hear <eol> through the low murmur of the leaves that stir <eol> the tinkling teardrop of la roche qui pleure <eol>
