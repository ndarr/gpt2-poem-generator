oh , modest maiden morn ! why dost thou blush <eol> who thus betimes art walking in the sky <eol> ‘ tis i , whose cheek bears pleasure 's sleepless flush <eol> who shame to meet thy gray , cloud lidded eye <eol> shadowy , yet clear : from the bright eastern door <eol> where the sun 's shafts lie bound with thongs of fire <eol> along the heaven 's amber paved floor <eol> the glad hours move , hymning their early choir <eol> o , fair and fragrant morn ! upon my brow <eol> press thy fresh lips , shake from thy dropping hair <eol> cold showers of balmy dew on me , and ere <eol> day 's chariot wheels upon th ’ horizon glow <eol> wrap me within thy sober cloak of gray <eol> and bear me to thy twilight bowers away <eol>
