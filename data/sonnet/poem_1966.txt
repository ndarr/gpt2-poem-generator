how can i woo you in this ancient suit <eol> you do not notice it , of course ; i know it <eol> my soul is burdened with a shapeless boot <eol> your heart is singing welcome to your poet <eol> here in the shadowy settle i can sit <eol> and sparkle with you , brightly confidential <eol> but when into the lamp bright zone you flit <eol> i shrink into some corner penitential <eol> a well dressed crowd , their tailors all unpaid <eol> throng round you there , and cuffs and collars glisten <eol> of pity 's blindness , as of scorn , afraid <eol> i shun the merry fray , and darkling listen <eol> for who could urge the timidest of suits <eol> conscious of such indifferent clothes and boots <eol>
