a smile is curving o'er her creamy cheek <eol> her bosom swells with all a lover 's joy <eol> when love receives a message that the coy <eol> young love god made a strong and true heart speak <eol> from far off lands ; and like a mountain peak <eol> that loses in one avalanche its cloy <eol> of ice and snow , so doth her breast employ <eol> its hidden store of blushes ; and they wreak <eol> destruction , as they crush my aching heart <eol> destruction , wild , relentless , and as sure <eol> as the poor alpine hamlet 's ; and no art <eol> can hide my agony , no herb can cure <eol> my wound . her very blush says , â€œ we must part <eol> why was it always my fate to endure <eol>
