if thou must love me , let it be for nought <eol> except for love 's sake only . do not say <eol> “ i love her for her smile — her look — her way <eol> of speaking gently ,— for a trick of thought <eol> that falls in well with mine , and certes brought <eol> a sense of pleasant ease on such a day <eol> for these things in themselves , beloved , may <eol> be changed , or change for thee ,— and love , so wrought <eol> may be unwrought so . neither love me for <eol> thine own dear pity 's wiping my cheeks dry <eol> a creature might forget to weep , who bore <eol> thy comfort long , and lose thy love thereby <eol> but love me for love 's sake , that evermore <eol> thou may'st love on , through love 's eternity <eol>
