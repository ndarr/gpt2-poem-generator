alone , beneath the tower whence thunder forth <eol> the mandates of the tyrant of the north <eol> poland 's sad genius kneels , absorbed in tears <eol> bound , vanquished , pallid with her fears <eol> alas ! the crucifix is all that 's left <eol> to her , of freedom and her sons bereft <eol> and on her royal robe foul marks are seen <eol> where russian hectors â€™ scornful feet have been <eol> anon she hears the clank of murd'rous arms <eol> the swordsmen come once more to spread alarms <eol> and while she weeps against the prison walls <eol> and waves her bleeding arm until it falls <eol> to france she hopeless turns her glazing eyes <eol> and sues her sister 's succor ere she dies <eol>
