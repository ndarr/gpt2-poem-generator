how like a winter hath my absence been <eol> from thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year <eol> what freezings have i felt , what dark days seen <eol> what old december 's bareness everywhere <eol> and yet this time removed was summer 's time <eol> the teeming autumn big with rich increase <eol> bearing the wanton burden of the prime <eol> like widowed wombs after their lords ’ decease <eol> yet this abundant issue seemed to me <eol> but hope of orphans , and unfathered fruit <eol> for summer and his pleasures wait on thee <eol> and thou away , the very birds are mute <eol> or if they sing , ‘ tis with so dull a cheer <eol> that leaves look pale , dreading the winter 's near <eol>
