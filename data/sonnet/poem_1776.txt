if thou hadst built a temple , how my eye <eol> had hungering fed thereon , from low browed crypt <eol> up to the soaring pinnacles that , tipt <eol> with stars , gave signal when the sun drew nigh <eol> dark caverns in and under ; vivid sky <eol> its home and aim ! say , from the glory slipt <eol> and down into the shadows dropt and dipt <eol> or reared from darkness up so holy high <eol> thou build'st the temple of thy holy ghost <eol> from hid foundation to high hidden fate <eol> foot in the grave , head at the heavenly gate <eol> from grave and sky filled with a fighting host <eol> man is thy temple ; man thy work elect <eol> his glooms and glory thine , great architect <eol>
