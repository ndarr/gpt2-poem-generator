o silent lover of a world day worn <eol> taking the weary light to thy dusk arms <eol> stealing where pale forms lie , sun hurt and torn <eol> waiting the balm of thy oblivious charms <eol> make me thy captive ere i guess pursuit <eol> and cast me deep within some dreamless close <eol> where hopes stir not , and white , wronged lips are mute <eol> and pain 's hot wings fold down o'er hush Ã¨ d woes <eol> and if ere morn thou choosest me to free <eol> let it not be , dear jailer , through the door <eol> that timeward opes , but to eternity <eol> set thou the soul that needs thee nevermore <eol> so i from sleep to death may softly wend <eol> as one would pass from gentle friend to friend <eol>
