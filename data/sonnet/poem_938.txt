she gave up beauty in her tender youth <eol> gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways <eol> she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze <eol> on vanity , and chose the bitter truth <eol> harsh towards herself , towards others full of ruth <eol> servant of servants , little known to praise <eol> long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days <eol> she schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth <eol> that with the poor and stricken she might make <eol> a home , until the least of all sufficed <eol> her wants ; her own self learned she to forsake <eol> counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss <eol> so with calm will she chose and bore the cross <eol> and hated all for love of jesus christ <eol>
