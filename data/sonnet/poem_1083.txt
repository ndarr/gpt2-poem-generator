so reuben 's life in full leaf stood , its fruit <eol> hidden in a green expectancy ; but all <eol> his days were rounded with ripe consciousness <eol> while jerry felt the winter 's whitening blight <eol> as when that frosty fern work and those palms <eol> of visionary leaf , and trailing vines <eol> quaint chased by night winds on the pane , melt off <eol> and naked earth , stone stiff , with bristling trees <eol> stares in the winter sunlight coldly through <eol> but yet he rose , and clothed himself amain <eol> with misery , and once more put on life <eol> as a stained garment . highly he resolved <eol> to make his deedless days henceforward strike <eol> pure harmony â€” a psalm of silences <eol>
