to day , all day , i rode upon the down <eol> with hounds and horsemen , a brave company <eol> on this side in its glory lay the sea <eol> on that the sussex weald , a sea of brown <eol> the wind was light , and brightly the sun shone <eol> and still we galloped on from gorse to gorse <eol> and once , when checked , a thrush sang , and my horse <eol> pricked his quick ears as to a sound unknown <eol> i knew the spring was come . i knew it even <eol> better than all by this , that through my chase <eol> in bush and stone and hill and sea and heaven <eol> i seemed to see and follow still your face <eol> your face my quarry was . for it i rode <eol> my horse a thing of wings , myself a god <eol>
