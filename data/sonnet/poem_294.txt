fair star of evening , splendor of the west <eol> star of my country ! on the horizon 's brink <eol> thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink <eol> on england 's bosom ; yet well pleas 'd to rest <eol> meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest <eol> conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think <eol> should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink <eol> bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest <eol> in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot <eol> beneath thee , it is england ; there it lies <eol> blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot <eol> one life , one glory ! i , with many a fear <eol> for my dear country , many heartfelt sighs <eol> among men who do not love her linger here <eol>
