fair art thou , phillis , ay , so fair , sweet maid <eol> as nor the sun , nor i have seen more fair <eol> for in thy cheeks sweet roses are embayed <eol> and gold more pure than gold doth gild thy hair <eol> sweet bees have hived their honey on thy tongue <eol> and hebe spiced her nectar with thy breath <eol> about thy neck do all the graces throng <eol> and lay such baits as might entangle death <eol> in such a breast what heart would not be thrall <eol> from such sweet arms who would not wish embraces <eol> at thy fair hands who wonders not at all <eol> wonder itself through ignorance embases <eol> yet natheless though wondrous gifts you call these <eol> my faith is far more wonderful than all these <eol>
