i said i splendidly loved you ; it 's not true <eol> such long swift tides stir not a land locked sea <eol> on gods or fools the high risk falls — on you <eol> the clean clear bitter sweet that 's not for me <eol> love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist <eol> love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell <eol> but — there are wanderers in the middle mist <eol> who cry for shadows , clutch , and cannot tell <eol> whether they love at all , or , loving , whom <eol> an old song 's lady , a fool in fancy dress <eol> or phantoms , or their own face on the gloom <eol> for love of love , or from heart 's loneliness <eol> pleasure 's not theirs , nor pain . they doubt , and sigh <eol> and do not love at all . of these am i <eol>
