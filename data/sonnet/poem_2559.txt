reignin my thoughts , fair hand , sweet eye , rare voice <eol> possess me whole , my heart 's triumvirate <eol> yet heavy heart , to make so hard a choice <eol> of such as spoil thy poor afflicted state <eol> for whilst they strive which shall be lord of all <eol> all my poor life by them is trodden down <eol> they all erect their trophies on my fall <eol> and yield me nought that gives them their renown <eol> when back i look , i sigh my freedom past <eol> and wail the state wherein i present stand <eol> and see my fortune ever like to last <eol> finding me reined with such a heavy hand <eol> what can i do but yield ? and yield i do <eol> and serve all three , and yet they spoil me too <eol>
