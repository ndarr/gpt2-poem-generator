when all my trivial rhymes are blotted out <eol> vanished our days , so precious and so few <eol> if some should wonder what we were about <eol> and what the little happenings we knew <eol> i wish that they might know how , night by night <eol> my pencil , heavy in the sleepy hours <eol> sought vainly for some gracious way to write <eol> how much this love is ours , and only ours <eol> how many evenings , as you drowsed to sleep <eol> i read to you by tawny candle glow <eol> and watched you down the valley dim and deep <eol> where poppies and the april flowers grow <eol> then knelt beside your pillow with a prayer <eol> and loved the breath of pansies in your hair <eol>
