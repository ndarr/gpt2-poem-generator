not from without us , only from within <eol> comes or can ever come upon us light <eol> whereby the soul keeps ever truth in sight <eol> no truth , no strength , no comfort man may win <eol> no grace for guidance , no release from sin <eol> save of his own soul 's giving . deep and bright <eol> as fire enkindled in the core of night <eol> burns in the soul where once its fire has been <eol> the light that leads and quickens thought , inspired <eol> to doubt and trust and conquer . so he said <eol> whom sidney , flower of england , lordliest head <eol> of all we love , loved : but the fates required <eol> a sacrifice to hate and hell , ere fame <eol> should set with his in heaven giordano 's name <eol>
