thinking of you , and all that was , and all <eol> that might have been and now can never be <eol> i feel your honored excellence , and see <eol> myself unworthy of the happier call <eol> for woe is me who walk so apt to fall <eol> so apt to shrink afraid , so apt to flee <eol> apt to lie down and die ( ah , woe is me <eol> faithless and hopeless turning to the wall <eol> and yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite <eol> because not loveless ; love may toil all night <eol> but take at morning ; wrestle till the break <eol> of day , but then wield power with god and man <eol> so take i heart of grace as best i can <eol> ready to spend and be spent for your sake <eol>
