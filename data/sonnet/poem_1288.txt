it is my dream to have you here with me <eol> out of the heated city 's dust and din <eol> here where the colts have room to gambol in <eol> and kine to graze , in clover to the knee <eol> i want to see your wan face happily <eol> lit with the wholesome smiles that have not been <eol> in use since the old games you used to win <eol> when we pitched horseshoes : and i want to be <eol> at utter loaf with you in this dim land <eol> of grove and meadow , while the crickets make <eol> our own talk tedious , and the bat wields <eol> his bulky flight , as we cease converse and <eol> in a dusk like velvet smoothly take <eol> our way toward home across the dewy fields <eol>
