when i consider every thing that grows <eol> holds in perfection but a little moment <eol> that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows <eol> whereon the stars in secret influence comment <eol> when i perceive that men as plants increase <eol> cheered and checked even by the self same sky <eol> vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease <eol> and wear their brave state out of memory <eol> then the conceit of this inconstant stay <eol> sets you most rich in youth before my sight <eol> where wasteful time debateth with decay <eol> to change your day of youth to sullied night <eol> and all in war with time for love of you <eol> as he takes from you , i engraft you new <eol>
