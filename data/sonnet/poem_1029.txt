music to hear , why hear'st thou music sadly <eol> sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy <eol> why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly <eol> or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy <eol> if the true concord of well tuned sounds <eol> by unions married do offend thine ear <eol> they do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds <eol> in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear <eol> mark how one string sweet husband to another <eol> strikes each in each by mutual ordering <eol> resembling sire , and child , and happy mother <eol> who all in one , one pleasing note do sing <eol> whose speechless song being many , seeming one <eol> sings this to thee , â€˜ thou single wilt prove none <eol>
