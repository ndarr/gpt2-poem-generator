fair eyes , whilst fearful i your fair admire <eol> by unexpress Ã¨ d sweetness that i gain <eol> my memory of sorrow doth expire <eol> and falcon like , i tower joy 's heavens amain <eol> but when your suns in oceans of their glory <eol> shut up their day bright shine , i die for thought <eol> so pass my joys as doth a new played story <eol> and one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught <eol> so to myself i live not , but for you <eol> for you i live , and you i love , but none else <eol> oh then , fair eyes , whose light i live to view <eol> or poor forlorn despised to live alone else <eol> look sweet , since from the pith of contemplation <eol> love gathereth life , and living , breedeth passion <eol>
