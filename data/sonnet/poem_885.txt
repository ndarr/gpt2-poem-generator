oft and in vain my rebel thoughts have ventured <eol> to stop the passage of my vanquished heart <eol> and shut those ways my friendly foe first entered <eol> hoping thereby to free my better part <eol> and whilst i guard the windows of this fort <eol> where my heart 's thief to vex me made her choice <eol> and thither all my forces do transport <eol> another passage opens at her voice <eol> her voice betrays me to her hand and eye <eol> my freedom 's tyrant , conquering all by art <eol> but ah ! what glory can she get thereby <eol> with three such powers to plague one silly heart <eol> yet my soul 's sovereign , since i must resign <eol> reign in my thoughts , my love and life are thine <eol>
