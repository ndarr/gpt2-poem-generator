as due by many titles , i resign <eol> myself to thee , o god ! first i was made <eol> by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed <eol> thy blood bought that , the which before was thine <eol> i am thy son , made with thyself to shine <eol> thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid <eol> thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed <eol> myself , a temple of thy spirit divine <eol> why doth the devil then usurp on me <eol> why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right <eol> except thou rise , and for thine own work fight <eol> oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see <eol> that thou lov'st mankind well , yet wilt not choose me <eol> and satan hates me , yet is loth to lose me <eol>
