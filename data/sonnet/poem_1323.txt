festivals have i seen that were not names <eol> this is young buonaparte 's natal day <eol> and his is henceforth an established sway <eol> consul for life . with worship france proclaims <eol> her approbation , and with pomps and games <eol> heaven grant that other cities may be gay <eol> calais is not : and i have bent my way <eol> to the sea coast , noting that each man frames <eol> his business as he likes . another time <eol> that was , when i was here long years ago <eol> the senselessness of joy was then sublime <eol> happy is he , who , caring not for pope <eol> consul , or king , can sound himself to know <eol> the destiny of man , and live in hope <eol>
