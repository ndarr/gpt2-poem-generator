we mourn not for our martyrs !â€” for they perish <eol> as the good perish , for a deathless faith <eol> their glorious memories men will fondly cherish <eol> in terms and signs that shall ennoble death <eol> their blood becomes a principle , to guide <eol> onward , forever onward , in proud flow <eol> restless , resistless , as the ocean tide <eol> the spirit heaven yields freedom here below <eol> how should we mourn the martyrs , who arise <eol> even from the stake and scaffold , to the skies <eol> and take their thrones , as slars ; and o'er the night <eol> shed a new glory ; and to other souls <eol> shine out with blessed guidance , and true light <eol> which leads successive races to their goals <eol>
