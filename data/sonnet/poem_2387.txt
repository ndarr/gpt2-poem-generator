the weary mariner so fast not flies <eol> a howling tempest , harbour to attain <eol> nor shepherd hastes , when frays of wolves arise <eol> so fast to fold , to save his bleating train <eol> as i , wing 'd with contempt and just disdain <eol> now fly the world , and what it most doth prize <eol> and sanctuary seek , free to remain <eol> from wounds of abject times , and envy 's eyes <eol> to me this world did once seem sweet and fair <eol> while senses â€™ light mind 's prospective kept blind <eol> now , like imagined landscape in the air <eol> and weeping rainbows , her best joys i find <eol> or if aught here is had that praise should have <eol> it is a life obscure , and silent grave <eol>
