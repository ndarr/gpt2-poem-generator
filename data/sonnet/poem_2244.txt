thou wouldst have led us through the twilight land <eol> where spirit shows by form , form is refined <eol> away to spirit by transfiguring mind <eol> till they are one , and in the morn we stand <eol> treading thy footsteps , children , hand in hand <eol> with sense divinely growing , till , combined <eol> we heard the music of the planets wind <eol> in harmony with billows on the strand <eol> till , one with earth and all god 's utterance <eol> we hardly knew whether the sun outspake <eol> or a glad sunshine from our spirits brake <eol> whether we think , or windy leaflets dance <eol> alas , o poet leader ! for this good <eol> thou wert god 's tragedy , writ in tears and blood <eol>
