now is the blackest hour of the long night <eol> the soul of midnight . now , the pallid stars <eol> shine in the highest silver and the wind <eol> that creepeth chill across the sleeping world <eol> holdeth no hint of morning . i look out <eol> into the glory of the night with tired <eol> wide , sleepless eyes and think of you . there is <eol> the hush of some great spirit o'er the earth <eol> here , in the silence earth and sky are met <eol> and merged into infinity . oh , god <eol> of all , thou who beholdest destiny <eol> as simple , thou who understandest life <eol> from birth to re birth , who knows all our souls <eol> grant her thy perfect benediction , rest <eol>
