and yet , because thou overcomest so <eol> because thou art more noble and like a king <eol> thou canst prevail against my fears and fling <eol> thy purple round me , till my heart shall grow <eol> too close against thine heart henceforth to know <eol> how it shook when alone . why , conquering <eol> may prove as lordly and complete a thing <eol> in lifting upward , as in crushing low <eol> and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword <eol> to one who lifts him from the bloody earth <eol> even so , beloved , i at last record <eol> here ends my strife . if thou invite me forth <eol> i rise above abasement at the word <eol> make thy love larger to enlarge my worth <eol>
