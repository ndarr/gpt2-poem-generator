pale are my looks , forsaken of my life <eol> cinders my bones , consum è d with thy flame <eol> floods are my tears , to end this burning strife <eol> and yet i sigh for to increase the same <eol> i mourn alone because alone i burn <eol> who doubts of this , then let him learn to love <eol> her looks cold ice into a flame can turn <eol> as i distress è d in myself do prove <eol> respect , fair licia , what my torments are <eol> count but the tithe both of my sighs and tears <eol> see how my love doth still increase my care <eol> and care 's increase my life to nothing wears <eol> send but a sigh my flame for to increase <eol> or lend a tear and cause it so to cease <eol>
