we wander on through life as pilgrims do <eol> o'er trackless deserts to a distant shrine <eol> weary and parch 'd , and to our longing view <eol> springs many a false mirage of joy divine <eol> that fades before us as we fain pursue <eol> the empty picture which our fancy drew <eol> o thou , my heart ! seek not the empty shows <eol> and gilded nothings of this little time <eol> but let thine endless effort be to climb <eol> above earth 's petty vanities and woes <eol> unto a nobler range of feelings , joys <eol> which no false leaven of decay alloys <eol> but whose substantial sweetness may increase <eol> and make thy journey pleasure , and thy slumber peace <eol>
