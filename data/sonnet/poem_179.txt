oh , think not i am faithful to a vow <eol> faithless am i save to love 's self alone <eol> were you not lovely i would leave you now <eol> after the feet of beauty fly my own <eol> were you not still my hunger 's rarest food <eol> and water ever to my wildest thirst <eol> i would desert you â€” think not but i would <eol> and seek another as i sought you first <eol> but you are mobile as the veering air <eol> and all your charms more changeful than the tide <eol> wherefore to be inconstant is no care <eol> i have but to continue at your side <eol> so wanton , light and false , my love , are you <eol> i am most faithless when i most am true <eol>
