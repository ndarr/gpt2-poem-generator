oft do i marvel whether delia 's eyes <eol> are eyes , or else two radiant stars that shine <eol> for how could nature ever thus devise <eol> of earth , on earth , a substance so divine <eol> stars , sure , they are , whose motions rule desires <eol> and calm and tempest follow their aspects <eol> their sweet appearing still such power inspires <eol> that makes the world admire so strange effects <eol> yet whether fixed or wandering stars are they <eol> whose influence rules the orb of my poor heart <eol> fixed , sure , they are , but wandering make me stray <eol> in endless errors whence i cannot part <eol> stars , then , not eyes , move you with milder view <eol> your sweet aspect on him that honours you <eol>
