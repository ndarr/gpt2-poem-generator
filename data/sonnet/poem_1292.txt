the stars come out ; the fragrant shadows fall <eol> about a dreaming garden still and sweet <eol> i hear the unseen bats above me bleat <eol> among the ghostly moths their hunting call <eol> and twinkling glow worms all about me crawl <eol> now for a chamber dim , a pillow meet <eol> for slumbers deep as death , a faultless sheet <eol> cool , white and smooth . so may i reach the hall <eol> with poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear <eol> with magic sponge can wipe away an hour <eol> or twelve and make them naught . why not a year <eol> why could a man not loiter in that bower <eol> until a thousand painless cycles wore <eol> and then what if it held him evermore <eol>
