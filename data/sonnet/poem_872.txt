six thousand years of commune , god with man <eol> two thousand years of ohrist ; yet from such roots <eol> immortal , earth reaps only bitterest fruits <eol> the fiends rage now as when they first began <eol> hate , lust , greed , vanity , triumphant still <eol> yell , shout , exult , and lord o'er human will <eol> the sun moves back ! the fond convictions felt <eol> that , in the progress of the race , we stood <eol> two thousand years of height above the flood <eol> before the day 's experience sink and melt <eol> as frost beneath the fire ! and what remains <eol> of all our grand ideals and great gains <eol> with goth , hun , vandal , warring in their pride <eol> while the meek christ is hourly crucified <eol>
