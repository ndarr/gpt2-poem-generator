methought that in a solemn church i stood <eol> its marble acres , worn with knees and feet <eol> lay spread from door to door , from street to street <eol> midway the form hung high upon the rood <eol> of him who gave his life to be our good <eol> beyond , priests flitted , bowed , and murmured meet <eol> among the candles , shining still and sweet <eol> men came and went , and worshipped as they could <eol> and still their dust a woman with her broom <eol> bowed to her work , kept sweeping to the door <eol> then saw i , slow through all the pillared gloom <eol> across the church a silent figure come <eol> “ daughter , ” it said , “ thou sweepest well my floor <eol> “ it is the lord ! ” i cried , and saw no more <eol>
