when to the sessions of sweet silent thought <eol> i summon up remembrance of things past <eol> i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought <eol> and with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste <eol> then can i drown an eye ( unused to flow <eol> for precious friends hid in death 's dateless night <eol> and weep afresh love 's long since cancelled woe <eol> and moan th â€™ expense of many a vanished sight <eol> then can i grieve at grievances foregone <eol> and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er <eol> the sad account of fore bemoaned moan <eol> which i new pay as if not paid before <eol> but if the while i think on thee ( dear friend <eol> all losses are restored , and sorrows end <eol>
