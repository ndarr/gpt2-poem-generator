ay me ! ay me ! with what another heart <eol> in days far off , and with what other eyes <eol> i used to watch â€” if i be he that watch 'd <eol> the lucid outline forming round thee ; saw <eol> the dim curls kindle into sunny rings <eol> changed with thy mystic change , and felt my blood <eol> glow with the glow that slowly crimson 'd all <eol> thy presence and thy portals , while i lay <eol> mouth , forehead , eyelids , growing dewy warm <eol> with kisses balmier than half opening buds <eol> of april , and could hear the lips that kiss 'd <eol> whispering i knew not what of wild and sweet <eol> like that strange song i heard apollo sing <eol> while ilion like a mist rose into towers <eol>
