hope , like the hyaena , coming to be old <eol> alters his shape , is turned into despair <eol> pity my hoary hopes , maid of clear mould <eol> think not that frowns can ever make thee fair <eol> what harm is it to kiss , to laugh , to play <eol> beauty 's no blossom , if it be not used <eol> sweet dalliance keeps the wrinkles long away <eol> repentance follows them that have refused <eol> to bring you to the knowledge of your good <eol> i seek , i sue . o try and then believe <eol> each image can be chaste that 's carved of wood <eol> you show you live , when men you do relieve <eol> iron with wearing shines ; rust wasteth treasure <eol> on earth but love there is no other pleasure <eol>
