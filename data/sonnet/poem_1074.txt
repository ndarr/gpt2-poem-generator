what say'st thou , dobbin ? what though hounds await <eol> with open jaws the moment of thy fate <eol> no better fate attends his public race <eol> his life is misery , and his end disgrace <eol> then freely bear thy burden to the mill <eol> obey but one short law ,... thy driver 's will <eol> affection , to thy memory ever true <eol> shall boast of mighty loads that dobbin drew <eol> and back to childhood shall the mind with pride <eol> recount thy gentleness in many a ride <eol> to pond , or field , or village fair , when thou <eol> held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow <eol> and oft the tale shall rise to homely fame <eol> upon thy gen'rous spirit and thy name <eol>
