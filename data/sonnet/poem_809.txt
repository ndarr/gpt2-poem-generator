in fancy 's world an atlas have i been <eol> where yet the chaos of my ceaseless care <eol> is by her eyes unpitied and unseen <eol> in whom all gifts but pity planted are <eol> for mercy though still cries my moan clad muse <eol> and every paper that she sends to beauty <eol> in tract of sable tears brings woeful news <eol> of my true heart kind thoughts , and loyal duty <eol> but ah the strings of her hard heart are strained <eol> beyond the harmony of my desires <eol> and though the happy heavens themselves have pained <eol> to tame her heart whose will so far aspires <eol> yet she who claims the title of world 's wonder <eol> thinks all deserts too base to bring her under <eol>
