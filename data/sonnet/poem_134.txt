son of the lightning and the light that glows <eol> beyond the lightning 's or the morning 's light <eol> soul splendid with all righteous love of right <eol> in whose keen fire all hopes and fears and woes <eol> were clean consumed , and from their ashes rose <eol> transfigured , and intolerable to sight <eol> save of purged eyes whose lids had cast off night <eol> in love 's and wisdom 's likeness when they close <eol> embracing , and between them truth stands fast <eol> embraced of either ; thou whose feet were set <eol> on english earth while this was england yet <eol> our friend that art , our sidney 's friend that wast <eol> heart hardier found and higher than all men 's past <eol> shall we not praise thee though thine own forget <eol>
