i purposed once to take my pen and write <eol> not songs , like some , tormented and awry <eol> with passion , but a cunning harmony <eol> of words and music caught from glen and height <eol> and lucid colours born of woodland light <eol> and shining places where the sea streams lie <eol> but this was when the heat of youth glowed white <eol> and since i 've put the faded purpose by <eol> i have no faultless fruits to offer you <eol> who read this book ; but certain syllables <eol> herein are borrowed from unfooted dells <eol> and secret hollows dear to noontide dew <eol> and these at least , though far between and few <eol> may catch the sense like subtle forest spells <eol>
