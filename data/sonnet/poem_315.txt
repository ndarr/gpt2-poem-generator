if i could trust mine own self with your fate <eol> shall i not rather trust it in god 's hand <eol> without whose will one lily doth not stand <eol> nor sparrow fall at his appointed date <eol> who numbereth the innumerable sand <eol> who weighs the wind and water with a weight <eol> to whom the world is neither small nor great <eol> whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned <eol> searching my heart for all that touches you <eol> i find there only love and love 's goodwill <eol> helpless to help and impotent to do <eol> of understanding dull , of sight most dim <eol> and therefore i commend you back to him <eol> whose love your love 's capacity can fill <eol>
