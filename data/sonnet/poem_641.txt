so oft have i invoked thee for my muse <eol> and found such fair assistance in my verse <eol> as every alien pen hath got my use <eol> and under thee their poesy disperse <eol> thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing <eol> and heavy ignorance aloft to fly <eol> have added feathers to the learned 's wing <eol> and given grace a double majesty <eol> yet be most proud of that which i compile <eol> whose influence is thine , and born of thee <eol> in others â€™ works thou dost but mend the style <eol> and arts with thy sweet graces graced be <eol> but thou art all my art , and dost advance <eol> as high as learning , my rude ignorance <eol>
