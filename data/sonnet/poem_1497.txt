afar in the desert i love to ride <eol> with the silent bush boy alone by my side <eol> o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry <eol> of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively <eol> and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh <eol> is heard by the fountain at twilight gray <eol> where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane <eol> with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain <eol> and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste <eol> speeds like a horseman who travels in haste <eol> hieing away to the home of her rest <eol> where she and her mate have scooped their nest <eol> far hid from the pitiless plunderer 's view <eol> in the pathless depths of the parched karroo <eol>
