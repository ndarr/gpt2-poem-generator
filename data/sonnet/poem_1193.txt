farewell , my best beloved ! whose heavenly mind <eol> genius with virtue , strength with softness join 'd <eol> devotion , undebased by pride or art <eol> with meek simplicity , and joy of heart <eol> though sprightly , gentle ; though polite , sincere <eol> and only of thyself a judge severe <eol> unblamed , unequall 'd in each sphere of life <eol> the tenderest daughter , sister , parent , wife <eol> in thee , their patroness the afflicted lost <eol> thy friends their pattern , ornament , and boast <eol> and i â€” but ah , can words my loss declare <eol> or paint the extremes of transport and despair <eol> o thou , beyond what verse or speech can tell <eol> my guide , my friend , my best beloved , farewell <eol>
