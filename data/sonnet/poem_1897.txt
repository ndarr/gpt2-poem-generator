no longer mourn for me when i am dead <eol> than you shall hear the surly sullen bell <eol> give warning to the world that i am fled <eol> from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell <eol> nay if you read this line , remember not <eol> the hand that writ it , for i love you so <eol> that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot <eol> if thinking on me then should make you woe <eol> o if ( i say ) you look upon this verse <eol> when i ( perhaps ) compounded am with clay <eol> do not so much as my poor name rehearse <eol> but let your love even with my life decay <eol> lest the wise world should look into your moan <eol> and mock you with me after i am gone <eol>
