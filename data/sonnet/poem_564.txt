the sirens once were maidens innocent <eol> that through the water meads with proserpine <eol> plucked no fire hearted flowers , but were content <eol> cool fritillaries and flag flowers to twine <eol> with lilies woven and with wet woodbine <eol> till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers <eol> and their glad mistress fled from summer hours <eol> with hades , far from olive , corn , and vine <eol> and they have sought her all the wide world through <eol> till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong <eol> have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue <eol> rings deadly sweet the magic of the song <eol> and whoso hears must listen till he die <eol> far on the flowery shores of sicily <eol>
