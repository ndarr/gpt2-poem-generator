i ask but one thing of you , only one <eol> that always you will be my dream of you <eol> that never shall i wake to find untrue <eol> all this i have believed and rested on <eol> forever vanished , like a vision gone <eol> out into the night . alas , how few <eol> there are who strike in us a chord we knew <eol> existed , but so seldom heard its tone <eol> we tremble at the half forgotten sound <eol> the world is full of rude awakenings <eol> and heaven born castles shattered to the ground <eol> yet still our human longing vainly clings <eol> to a belief in beauty through all wrongs <eol> o stay your hand , and leave my heart its songs <eol>
