diodati — and i muse to tell the tale <eol> this stubborn i , that love was wont despise <eol> and make a laughter of his snares , unwise <eol> am fallen — where honest feet will sometimes fail <eol> not golden tresses , not a cheek vermeil <eol> dazzle me thus ; but , in a new world guise <eol> a foreign fair my heart beatifies <eol> with mien where high souled modesty i hail <eol> eyes softly splendent with a darkness dear <eol> a speech that more than one tongue vassal hath <eol> a voice that in the middle hemisphere <eol> might make the tired moon wander from her path <eol> while from her eyes such gracious flashes shoot <eol> that stopping hard my ears were little boot <eol>
