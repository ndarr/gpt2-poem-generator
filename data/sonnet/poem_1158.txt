where shall a sorrow great enough be sought <eol> for this sad ruin which the fates have wrought <eol> unless the fates themselves should weep and wish <eol> their curbless power had been controlled in this <eol> for thy loss , worthiest lord , no mourning eye <eol> has flood enough ; no muse nor elegy <eol> enough expression to thy worth can lend <eol> no , though thy sidney had survived his friend <eol> dead , noble brooke shall be to us a name <eol> of grief and honour still , whose deathless fame <eol> such virtue purchased as makes us to be <eol> unjust to nature in lamenting thee <eol> wailing an old man 's fate as if in pride <eol> and heat of youth he had untimely died <eol>
