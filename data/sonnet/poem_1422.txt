now surely is the hour come for farewell <eol> now , with the lessened light and darkened days <eol> who now would tread the wild hill 's pathless ways <eol> we found so fair when spring and summer 's spell <eol> made blind our hearts this parting to foretell <eol> yet why , while wan and wintry sunlight stays <eol> on perished gold of autumn fields , delays <eol> your heart to speak , while both our hearts rebel <eol> together we have gathered through the year <eol> all that the year could give us of its best <eol> is it not meet our parting should be here <eol> now in the season drear of death and rest <eol> yet since together we its joys have known <eol> how shall each meet the strange new year alone <eol>
