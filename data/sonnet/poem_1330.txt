remember me when i am gone away <eol> gone far away into the silent land <eol> when you can no more hold me by the hand <eol> nor i half turn to go yet turning stay <eol> remember me when no more day by day <eol> you tell me of our future that you planned <eol> only remember me ; you understand <eol> it will be late to counsel then or pray <eol> yet if you should forget me for a while <eol> and afterwards remember , do not grieve <eol> for if the darkness and corruption leave <eol> a vestige of the thoughts that once i had <eol> better by far you should forget and smile <eol> than that you should remember and be sad <eol>
