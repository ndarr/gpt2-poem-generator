â€œ the barley harvest was nodding white <eol> when my children died on the rocky height <eol> and the reapers were singing on hill and plain <eol> when i came to my task of sorrow and pain <eol> but now the season of rain is nigh <eol> the sun is dim in the thickening sky <eol> and the clouds in sullen darkness rest <eol> where he hides his light at the doors of the west <eol> i hear the howl of the wind that brings <eol> the long drear storm on its heavy wings <eol> but the howling wind and the driving rain <eol> will beat on my houseless head in vain <eol> i shall stay , from my murdered sons to scare <eol> the beasts of the desert , and fowls of air <eol>
