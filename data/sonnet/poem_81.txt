dear unborn children , to our mother 's trust <eol> we leave you , fearless , when we lie in dust <eol> while o'er these walls the christian banner waves <eol> from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves <eol> while o'er those portals veritas you read <eol> no church shall bind you with its human creed <eol> take from the past the best its toil has won <eol> but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun <eol> pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed <eol> quit the old paths that error loved to tread <eol> and a new wreath of living blossoms seek <eol> a narrower pathway up a loftier peak <eol> lose not your reverence , but unmanly fear <eol> leave far behind you , all who enter here <eol>
