my grief begun , fair saint , when first i saw <eol> love in those eyes sit ruling with disdain <eol> whose sweet commands did keep a world in awe <eol> and caused them serve your favor to obtain <eol> i stood as one enchanted with a frown <eol> yet smiled to see all creatures serve those eyes <eol> where each with sighs paid tribute to that crown <eol> and thought them grac Ã¨ d by your dumb replies <eol> but i , ambitious , could not be content <eol> till that my service more than sighs made known <eol> and for that end my heart to you i sent <eol> to say and swear that , fair , it is your own <eol> then greater graces , licia , do impart <eol> not dumb replies unto a speaking heart <eol>
