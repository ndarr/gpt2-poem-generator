the path runs straight between the flowering rows <eol> a moonlit path , hemmed in by beds of bloom <eol> where phlox and marigolds dispute for room <eol> with tall , red dahlias and the briar rose <eol> â€˜ t is reckless prodigality which throws <eol> into the night these wafts of rich perfume <eol> which sweep across the garden like a plume <eol> over the trees a single bright star glows <eol> dear garden of my childhood , here my years <eol> have run away like little grains of sand <eol> the moments of my life , its hopes and fears <eol> have all found utterance here , where now i stand <eol> my eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears <eol> you are my home , do you not understand <eol>
