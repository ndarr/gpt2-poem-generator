care charmer sleep , son of the sable night <eol> brother to death , in silent darkness born <eol> relieve my anguish , and restore the light <eol> with dark forgetting of my care , return <eol> and let the day be time enough to mourn <eol> the shipwreck of my ill advised youth <eol> let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn <eol> without the torments of the night 's untruth <eol> cease , dreams , the images of day desires <eol> to model forth the passions of to morrow <eol> never let the rising sun prove you liars <eol> to add more grief , to aggravate my sorrow <eol> still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain <eol> and never wake to feel the day 's disdain <eol>
