the soul 's rialto hath its merchandize <eol> i barter curl for curl upon that mart <eol> and from my poet 's forehead to my heart <eol> receive this lock which outweighs argosies <eol> as purply black , as erst to pindar 's eyes <eol> the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart <eol> the nine white muse brows . for this counterpart <eol> the bay crown 's shade , beloved , i surmise <eol> still lingers on thy curl , it is so black <eol> thus , with a fillet of smooth kissing breath <eol> i tie the shadows safe from gliding back <eol> and lay the gift where nothing hindereth <eol> here on my heart , as on thy brow , to lack <eol> no natural heat till mine grows cold in death <eol>
