when i have borne in memory what has tamed <eol> great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart <eol> when men change swords for ledgers , and desert <eol> the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed <eol> i had , my country ! am i to be blamed <eol> but , when i think of thee , and what thou art <eol> verily , in the bottom of my heart <eol> of those unfilial fears i am ashamed <eol> but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find <eol> in thee a bulwark of the cause of men <eol> and i by my affection was beguiled <eol> what wonder , if a poet , now and then <eol> among the many movements of his mind <eol> felt for thee as a lover or a child <eol>
