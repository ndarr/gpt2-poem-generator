look in my griefs , and blame me not to mourn <eol> from care to care that leads a life so bad <eol> th'orphan of fortune , born to be her scorn <eol> whose clouded brow doth make my days so sad <eol> long are their nights whose cares do never sleep <eol> loathsome their days who never sun yet joyed <eol> the impression of her eyes do pierce so deep <eol> that thus i live both day and night annoyed <eol> yet since the sweetest root yields fruit so sour <eol> her praise from my complaint i may not part <eol> i love th'effect , the cause being of this power <eol> i 'll praise her face and blame her flinty heart <eol> whilst we both make the world admire at us <eol> her for disdain , and me for loving thus <eol>
