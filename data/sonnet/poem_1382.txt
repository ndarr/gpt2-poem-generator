this then at last ; we may be wiser far <eol> than love , and put his folly to our measure <eol> yet shall we learn , poor wizards that we are <eol> that love chimes not nor motions at our pleasure <eol> we bid him come , and light an eager fire <eol> and he goes down the road without debating <eol> we cast him from the house of our desire <eol> and when at last we leave he will be waiting <eol> and in the end there is no folly but this <eol> to counsel love out of our little learning <eol> for still he knows where rotten timber is <eol> and where the boughs for the long winter burning <eol> and when life needs no more of us at all <eol> love 's word will be the last that we recall <eol>
