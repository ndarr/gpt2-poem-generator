peter , when thou this pleasant world dost see <eol> believe , thou seest mere dreams and vanity <eol> not real things , but false , and through the air <eol> each where an empty , slipp'ry scene , though fair <eol> the chirping birds , the fresh woods ’ shady boughs <eol> the leaves ’ shrill whispers , when the west wind blows <eol> the swift , fierce greyhounds coursing on the plains <eol> the flying hare , distress 'd ‘ twixt fear and pains <eol> the bloomy maid decking with flow'rs her head <eol> the gladsome , easy youth by light love led <eol> and whatsoe'er here with admiring eyes <eol> thou seem'st to see , ‘ tis but a frail disguise <eol> worn by eternal things , a passive dress <eol> put on by beings that are passiveless <eol>
