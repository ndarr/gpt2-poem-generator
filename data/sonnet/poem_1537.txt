the morning road is thronged with merry boys <eol> who seek the water for their sunday joys <eol> they run to seek the shallow pit , and wade <eol> and dance about the water in the shade <eol> the boldest ventures first and dashes in <eol> and others go and follow to the chin <eol> and duck about , and try to lose their fears <eol> and laugh to hear the thunder in their ears <eol> they bundle up the rushes for a boat <eol> and try across the deepest place to float <eol> beneath the willow trees they ride and stoop <eol> the awkward load will scarcely bear them up <eol> without their aid the others float away <eol> and play about the water half the day <eol>
