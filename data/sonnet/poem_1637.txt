when our two souls stand up erect and strong <eol> face to face , silent , drawing nigh and nigher <eol> until the lengthening wings break into fire <eol> at either curved point ,— what bitter wrong <eol> can the earth do to us , that we should not long <eol> be here contented ? think ! in mounting higher <eol> the angels would press on us and aspire <eol> to drop some golden orb of perfect song <eol> into our deep , dear silence . let us stay <eol> rather on earth , beloved ,— where the unfit <eol> contrarious moods of men recoil away <eol> and isolate pure spirits , and permit <eol> a place to stand and love in for a day <eol> with darkness and the death hour rounding it <eol>
