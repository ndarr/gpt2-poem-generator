the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance <eol> her white walls gleaming through the vines of france <eol> and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell <eol> on some high tower , of midnight sentinel <eol> but one still watched ; no self encircled woes <eol> chased from his lids the angel of repose <eol> he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years <eol> bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears <eol> his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame <eol> streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame <eol> each treasured insult , each remembered wrong <eol> rolled through his heart and kindled into song <eol> his taper faded ; and the morning gales <eol> swept through the world the war song of marseilles <eol>
