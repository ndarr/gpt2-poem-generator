thy satin vesture richer is than looms <eol> of orient weave for raiment of her kings <eol> not dyes of olden tyre , not precious things <eol> regathered from the long forgotten tombs <eol> of buried empires , not the iris plumes <eol> that wave upon the tropics ’ myriad wings <eol> not all proud sheba 's queenly offerings <eol> could match the golden marvel of thy blooms <eol> for thou art nurtured from the treasure veins <eol> of this fair land ; thy golden rootlets sup <eol> her sands of gold — of gold thy petals spun <eol> her golden glory , thou ! of hills and plains <eol> lifting , exultant , every kingly cup <eol> brimmed with the golden vintage of the sun <eol>
