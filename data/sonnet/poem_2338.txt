whilst i alone did call upon thy aid <eol> my verse alone had all thy gentle grace <eol> but now my gracious numbers are decayed <eol> and my sick muse doth give an other place <eol> i grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument <eol> deserves the travail of a worthier pen <eol> yet what of thee thy poet doth invent <eol> he robs thee of , and pays it thee again <eol> he lends thee virtue , and he stole that word <eol> from thy behaviour , beauty doth he give <eol> and found it in thy cheek : he can afford <eol> no praise to thee , but what in thee doth live <eol> then thank him not for that which he doth say <eol> since what he owes thee , thou thy self dost pay <eol>
