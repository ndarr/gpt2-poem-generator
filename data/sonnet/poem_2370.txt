full many a glorious morning have i seen <eol> flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye <eol> kissing with golden face the meadows green <eol> gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy <eol> anon permit the basest clouds to ride <eol> with ugly rack on his celestial face <eol> and from the forlorn world his visage hide <eol> stealing unseen to west with this disgrace <eol> even so my sun one early morn did shine <eol> with all triumphant splendour on my brow <eol> but out alack , he was but one hour mine <eol> the region cloud hath masked him from me now <eol> yet him for this , my love no whit disdaineth <eol> suns of the world may stain , when heaven 's sun staineth <eol>
