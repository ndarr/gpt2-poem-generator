always we are following a light <eol> always the light recedes ; with groping hands <eol> we stretch toward this glory , while the lands <eol> we journey through are hidden from our sight <eol> dim and mysterious , folded deep in night <eol> we care not , all our utmost need demands <eol> is but the light , the light ! so still it stands <eol> surely our own if we exert our might <eol> fool ! never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam <eol> its glowing flame would die if it were caught <eol> its value is that it doth always seem <eol> but just a little farther on . distraught <eol> but lighted ever onward , we are brought <eol> upon our way unknowing , in a dream <eol>
