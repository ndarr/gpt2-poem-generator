“ all , all are equal : heaven 's impartial mind <eol> one bliss , one woe allots to all mankind <eol> and he whose morn seem 'd wrapp 'd in cloudy night <eol> shall see his evening glow with placid light <eol> thro ’ calm prosperity 's serenest sky <eol> the approaching gales of adverse fortune sigh <eol> and when affliction whets her keenest dart <eol> and hurls it , flaming , at the shrinking heart <eol> celestial hope with golden wing attends <eol> heals every wound , and every toil befriends <eol> the horrors vanish ; gleams of light divine <eol> illume the cloud , and thro ’ its openings shine <eol> as the bow , herald of ethereal peace <eol> smiles thro ’ the storm , and makes the tempest please <eol>
