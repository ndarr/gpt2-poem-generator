these plaintive verse , the posts of my desire <eol> which haste for succour to her slow regard <eol> bear not report of any slender fire <eol> forging a grief to win a fame 's reward <eol> nor are my passions limned for outward hue <eol> for that no colours can depaint my sorrows <eol> delia herself , and all the world may view <eol> best in my face where cares have tilled deep furrows <eol> no bays i seek to deck my mourning brow <eol> o clear eyed rector of the holy hill <eol> my humble accents bear the olive bough <eol> of intercession but to move her will <eol> these lines i use t'unburden mine own heart <eol> my love affects no fame nor â€˜ steems of art <eol>
