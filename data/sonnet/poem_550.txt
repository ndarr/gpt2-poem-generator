in all my wanderings round this world of care <eol> in all my griefs — and god has given my share <eol> i still had hopes , my latest hours to crown <eol> amidst these humble bowers to lay me down <eol> to husband out life 's taper at the close <eol> and keep the flame from wasting by repose <eol> i still had hopes , for pride attends us still <eol> amidst the swains to show my book learned skill <eol> around my fire an evening group to draw <eol> and tell of all i felt , and all i saw <eol> and , as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue <eol> pants to the place from whence at first she flew <eol> i still had hopes , my long vexations past <eol> here to return — and die at home at last <eol>
