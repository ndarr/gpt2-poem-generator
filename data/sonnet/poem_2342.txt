love held me one and twenty years enchain 'd <eol> his flame was joy — for hope was in my grief <eol> for ten more years i wept without relief <eol> when laura with my heart , to heaven attain 'd <eol> now weary grown , my life i had arraign 'd <eol> that in its error , check 'd ( to my belief <eol> blest virtue 's seeds now , in my yellow leaf <eol> i grieve the mispent years , existence stain 'd <eol> alas ! it might have sought a brighter goal <eol> in flying troublous thoughts , and winning peace <eol> o father ! i repentant seek thy throne <eol> thou , in this temple hast enshrined my soul <eol> oh , bless me yet , and grant its safe release <eol> unjustified — my sin i humbly own <eol>
