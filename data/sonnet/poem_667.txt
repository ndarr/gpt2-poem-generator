sierra 's poet ! high and pure thy muse <eol> enthroned doth sit amongst the stars and snows <eol> and from thy harp olympian music flows <eol> of glacier heights and gleaming mountain dews <eol> of western sea and burning sunset hues <eol> and we who look up — who on the plain repose <eol> and catch faint glimpses of the mount that throws <eol> athwart thy poet sight diviner views <eol> and not alone from starry shrine is strung <eol> thy lyre , but timed to gentler lay <eol> that sings of children , motherhood and home <eol> and lifts our hearts and lives to sweeter day <eol> oh , bard of nature 's heart ! thy name will rest <eol> immortal in thy land — our golden west <eol>
