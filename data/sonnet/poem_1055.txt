i am in love with high far seeing places <eol> that look on plains half sunlight and half storm <eol> in love with hours when from the circling faces <eol> veils pass , and laughing fellowship glows warm <eol> you who look on me with grave eyes where rapture <eol> and april love of living burn confessed <eol> the gods are good ! the world lies free to capture <eol> life has no walls . o take me to your breast <eol> take me , â€” be with me for a moment 's span <eol> i am in love with all unveiled faces <eol> i seek the wonder at the heart of man <eol> i would go up to the far seeing places <eol> while youth is ours , turn toward me for a space <eol> the marvel of your rapture lighted face <eol>
