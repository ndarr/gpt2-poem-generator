first , most , to thee , my son , i give this book <eol> in which a friend 's and brother 's verses blend <eol> with mine ; for not son only — brother , friend <eol> art thou , through sonship which no veil can brook <eol> between the eyes that in each other look <eol> or any shadow ‘ twixt the hearts that tend <eol> still nearer , with divine approach , to end <eol> in love eternal that cannot be shook <eol> when all the shakable shall cease to be <eol> with growing hope i greet the coming day <eol> when from thy journey done i welcome thee <eol> who sharest in the names of all the three <eol> and take thee to the two , and humbly say <eol> let this man be the fourth with us , i pray <eol>
