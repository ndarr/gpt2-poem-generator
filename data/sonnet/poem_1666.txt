long have i loved the beauty of thy streets <eol> fair dublin : long , with unavailing vows <eol> sigh 'd to all guardian deities who rouse <eol> the spirits of dead nations to new heats <eol> of life and triumph :— vain the fond conceits <eol> nestling like eaves warmed doves ‘ neath patriot brows <eol> vain as the “ hope , ” that from thy custom house <eol> looks o'er the vacant bay in vain for fleets <eol> genius alone brings back the days of yore <eol> look ! look , what life is in these quaint old shops <eol> the loneliest lanes are rattling with the roar <eol> of coach and chair ; fans , feathers , flambeaus , fops <eol> flutter and flicker through yon open door <eol> where handel 's hand moves the great organ stops <eol>
