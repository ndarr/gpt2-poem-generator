what it is to breathe and live without life <eol> how to be pale with anguish , red with fear <eol> t'have peace abroad , and nought within but strife <eol> wish to be present , and yet shun t'appear <eol> how to be bold far off , and bashful near <eol> how to think much , and have no words to speak <eol> to crave redress , yet hold affliction dear <eol> to have affection strong , a body weak <eol> never to find , yet evermore to seek <eol> and seek that which i dare not hope to find <eol> t'affect this life and yet this life disleek <eol> grateful t'another , to myself unkind <eol> this cruel knowledge of these contraries <eol> delia , my heart hath learned out of those eyes <eol>
