bowed in the firelight 's softly climbing gleam <eol> i sit a shadow , in a shadow 's place <eol> while through the great , grey window vaguely stream <eol> twilight caresses on each pictured face <eol> that one hour gone was cold in art 's repose <eol> now each still canvas answers tremblingly <eol> till eyes unveil and living spirit glows <eol> where no light was while the rude day went by <eol> and rudest day , that passed so sternly bare <eol> cold as the life that walks without desire <eol> unbeauteous as duty or despair <eol> plucked by a hope that will not set her free <eol> turns back , while memory 's soft , informing fire <eol> falls on her face , and beauty looks at me <eol>
