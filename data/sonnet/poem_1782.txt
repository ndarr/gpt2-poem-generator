hide this one night thy crescent , kindly moon <eol> so shall endymion faithful prove , and rest <eol> loving and unawakened on thy breast <eol> so shall no foul enchanter importune <eol> thy quiet course ; for now the night is boon <eol> and through the friendly night unseen i fare <eol> who dread the face of foemen unaware <eol> and watch of hostile spies in the bright noon <eol> thou knowest , moon , the bitter power of love <eol> â€˜ tis told how shepherd pan found ways to move <eol> for little price , thy heart ; and of your grace <eol> sweet stars , be kind to this not alien fire <eol> because on earth ye did not scorn desire <eol> bethink ye , now ye hold your heavenly place <eol>
