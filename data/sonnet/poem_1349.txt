‘ my dearest lord ! farewell , ’ said he , ‘ farewell <eol> heaven bless the king ; may no misfortune tell <eol> the injustice of his hate when i am dead <eol> they 're coming now ; perhaps my guiltless head <eol> here , in your sight , must then a bleeding lie <eol> and scarce your own stand safe for being nigh <eol> think me not scared with death , howe'er ‘ t appear <eol> i know thou canst not think so : it is a fear <eol> from which thy love and dammin speaks me free <eol> i 've met him face to face , and ne'er could see <eol> one terror in his looks to make me fly <eol> when virtue bids me stand ; but i would die <eol> so as becomes my life , so as may prove <eol> saul 's malice , and at least excuse your love <eol>
