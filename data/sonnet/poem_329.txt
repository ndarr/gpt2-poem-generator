a vast cathedral by the western sea <eol> whose spires god set in majesty on high <eol> peak after peak of forests to the sky <eol> blended in one vast roof of greenery <eol> the nave , a river broadening to the sea <eol> the aisles , deep canyons of eternal build <eol> the transepts , valleys with god 's splendor filled <eol> the shrines , white waterfalls in leaf laced drapery <eol> the choir stands westward by the sounding shore <eol> the cliffs like beetling pipes set high in air <eol> roll from the beach the thunders crashing there <eol> the high wind voices chord the breakers â€™ roar <eol> and wondrous harmonies of praise and prayer <eol> swell to the forest altars evermore <eol>
