that time , fair licia , when i stole a kiss <eol> from off those lips , where cupid lovely laid <eol> i quaked for cold , and found the cause was this <eol> my life which loved , for love behind me staid <eol> i sent my heart my life for to recall <eol> but that was held , not able to return <eol> and both detained as captives were in thrall <eol> and judged by her , that both by sighs should burn <eol> fair , burn them both , for that they were so bold <eol> but let the altar be within thy heart <eol> and i shall live because my life you hold <eol> you that give life , to every living part <eol> a flame i took whenas i stole the kiss <eol> take you my life , yet can i live with this <eol>
