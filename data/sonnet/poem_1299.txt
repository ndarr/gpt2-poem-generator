ye , who by the couches of languishing ones <eol> have watched through the rising and setting of suns <eol> who , silent , behind the close curtain , withdrawn <eol> scarce know that the current of being sweeps on <eol> to whom outer life is unreal , untrue <eol> a world with whose moils ye have nothing to do <eol> who feel that the day , with its multiform rounds <eol> is full of discordant , impertinent sounds <eol> who speak in low whispers , and stealthily tread <eol> as if a faint footfall were something to dread <eol> who find all existence ,â€” its gladness , its gloom <eol> enclosed by the walls of that limited room <eol> ye only can measure the sleepless unrest <eol> that lies like a night mare on alice 's breast <eol>
