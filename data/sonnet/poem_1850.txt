hard are the rocks , the marble , and the steel <eol> the ancient oak with wind and weather tossed <eol> but you , my love , far harder do i feel <eol> than flint , or these , or is the winter 's frost <eol> my tears too weak , your heart they cannot move <eol> my sighs , that rock , like wind it cannot rent <eol> too tiger like you swear you cannot love <eol> but tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent <eol> the frost too hard , not melted with my flame <eol> i cinders am , and yet you feel no heat <eol> surpass not these , sweet love , for very shame <eol> but let my tears , my vows , my sighs entreat <eol> then shall i say as by trial find <eol> these all are hard , but you , my love , are kind <eol>
