“ what ! are th ’ infernal powers moved for me <eol> that all the hosts of hell me welcome give <eol> and claim me comrade in their revelry <eol> abhorrent things , i am not yours , i live <eol> i know i live because i think on death <eol> i live , dead things , to revel among tombs <eol> a ghoul , henceforth i feast on buried joys <eol> my soul the burial place , where lie , beneath <eol> a fearful night of cries and hellish spumes <eol> my lovely youth with jovial convoys <eol> hopes , happy eyed , and linked solaces <eol> and in the lapse of hateful years they will <eol> my guileless joys , my rose hued memories <eol> corrupt and rot and turn to venomed ill <eol>
