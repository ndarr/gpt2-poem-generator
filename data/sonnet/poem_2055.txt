o how thy worth with manners may i sing <eol> when thou art all the better part of me <eol> what can mine own praise to mine own self bring <eol> and what is't but mine own when i praise thee <eol> even for this , let us divided live <eol> and our dear love lose name of single one <eol> that by this separation i may give <eol> that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone <eol> o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove <eol> were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave <eol> to entertain the time with thoughts of love <eol> which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive <eol> and that thou teachest how to make one twain <eol> by praising him here who doth hence remain <eol>
