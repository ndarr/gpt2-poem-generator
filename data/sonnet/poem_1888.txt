i saw her like a shadow on the sky <eol> in the last light , a blur upon the sea <eol> then the gale 's darkness put the shadow by <eol> but from one grave that island talked to me <eol> and , in the midnight , in the breaking storm <eol> i saw its blackness and a blinking light <eol> and thought , â€œ so death obscures your gentle form <eol> so memory strives to make the darkness bright <eol> and , in that heap of rocks , your body lies <eol> part of the island till the planet ends <eol> my gentle comrade , beautiful and wise <eol> part of this crag this bitter surge offends <eol> while i , who pass , a little obscure thing <eol> war with this force , and breathe , and am its king <eol>
