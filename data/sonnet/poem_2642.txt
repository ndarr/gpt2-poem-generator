oh let us never leave that happy throng <eol> from that low attitude of love not cease <eol> in all the world there is no other peace <eol> in all the world no other shield from wrong <eol> but chiefly , saviour , for thy feet we long <eol> for no vain quiet , for no pride 's increase <eol> but that , being weak , and thou divinely strong <eol> us from our hateful selves thou mayst release <eol> we wander from thy fold 's free holy air <eol> forget thy looks , and take our fill of sin <eol> but if thou keep us evermore within <eol> we never surely can forget thee there <eol> breathing thy breath , thy white robe given to wear <eol> and loving thee for all thou diedst to win <eol>
