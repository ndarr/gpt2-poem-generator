awake — arise ! all my stormy powers <eol> the earth , the fair earth , again is ours <eol> at my stern approach , pale autumn flings down <eol> in the dust her broken and faded crown <eol> at my glance the terrified mourner flies <eol> and the earth is filled with her doleful cries <eol> awake !— for the season of flowers is o'er <eol> my white banner unfurl on each northern shore <eol> ye have slumbered long in my icy chain <eol> ye are free to travel the land and main <eol> spirits of frost ! quit your mountains of snow <eol> will ye longer suffer the streams to flow <eol> up , up , and away from your rocky caves <eol> and herald me over the pathless waves <eol>
