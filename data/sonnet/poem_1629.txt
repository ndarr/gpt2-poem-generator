be wise as thou art cruel , do not press <eol> my tongue tied patience with too much disdain <eol> lest sorrow lend me words and words express <eol> the manner of my pity wanting pain <eol> if i might teach thee wit better it were <eol> though not to love , yet love to tell me so <eol> as testy sick men when their deaths be near <eol> no news but health from their physicians know <eol> for if i should despair i should grow mad <eol> and in my madness might speak ill of thee <eol> now this ill wresting world is grown so bad <eol> mad slanderers by mad ears believed be <eol> that i may not be so , nor thou belied <eol> bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide <eol>
