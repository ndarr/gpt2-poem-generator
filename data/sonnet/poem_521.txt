lady ! where'er you roam , whatever land <eol> woos the bright touches of that artist hand <eol> whether you sketch the valley 's golden meads <eol> where mazy linth his lingering current leads <eol> enamored catch the mellow hues that sleep <eol> at eve , on meillerie 's immortal steep <eol> or musing o'er the lake , at day 's decline <eol> mark the last shadow on that holy shrine <eol> where , many a night , the shade of tell complains <eol> of gallia 's triumph and helvetia 's chains <eol> oh ! lay the pencil for a moment by <eol> turn from the canvas that creative eye <eol> and let its splendor , like the morning ray <eol> upon a shepherd 's harp , illume my lay <eol>
