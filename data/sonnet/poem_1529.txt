the woman singeth at her spinning wheel <eol> a pleasant chant , ballad , or baracolle <eol> she thinketh of her song , upon the whole <eol> far more than of her flax ; and yet the reel <eol> is full , and artfully her fingers feel <eol> with quick adjustment , provident control <eol> the lines , too subtly twisted to unroll <eol> out to a perfect thread . i hence appeal <eol> to the dear christian church , that we may do <eol> our father 's business in these temples mirk <eol> thus , swift and steadfast ; thus , intent and strong <eol> while , thus , apart from toil , our souls pursue <eol> some high , calm , spheric tune and prove our work <eol> the better for the sweetness of our song <eol>
