man , earth 's poor shadow ! talks of earth 's decay <eol> but hath it nothing of eternal kin <eol> no majesty that shall not pass away <eol> no soul of greatness springing up within <eol> thought marks without hoar shadows of sublime <eol> pictures of power , which if not doomed to win <eol> eternity , stand laughing at old time <eol> for ages : in the grand ancestral line <eol> of things eternal , mounting to divine <eol> i read magnificence where ages pay <eol> worship like conquered foes to the apennine <eol> because they could not conquer . there sits day <eol> too high for night to come at â€” mountains shine <eol> outpeering time , too lofty for decay <eol>
