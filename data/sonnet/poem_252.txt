not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul <eol> of the wide world , dreaming on things to come <eol> can yet the lease of my true love control <eol> supposed as forfeit to a confined doom <eol> the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured <eol> and the sad augurs mock their own presage <eol> incertainties now crown themselves assured <eol> and peace proclaims olives of endless age <eol> now with the drops of this most balmy time <eol> my love looks fresh , and death to me subscribes <eol> since spite of him i 'll live in this poor rhyme <eol> while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes <eol> and thou in this shalt find thy monument <eol> when tyrants â€™ crests and tombs of brass are spent <eol>
