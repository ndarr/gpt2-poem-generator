light feet , dark violet eyes , and parted hair <eol> soft dimpled hands , white neck , and creamy breast <eol> are things on which the dazzled senses rest <eol> till the fond , fixed eyes , forget they stare <eol> from such fine pictures , heavens ! i cannot dare <eol> to turn my admiration , though unpossess 'd <eol> they be of what is worthy ,— though not drest <eol> in lovely modesty , and virtues rare <eol> yet these i leave as thoughtless as a lark <eol> these lures i straight forget ,— e'en ere i dine <eol> or thrice my palate moisten : but when i mark <eol> such charms with mild intelligences shine <eol> my ear is open like a greedy shark <eol> to catch the tunings of a voice divine <eol>
