and weep not , though the beautiful decay <eol> within thy heart , as daily in thine eyes <eol> thy heart must have its autumn , its pale skies <eol> leading , mayhap , to winter 's dim dismay <eol> yet doubt not . beauty doth not pass away <eol> her form departs not , though her body dies <eol> secure beneath the earth the snowdrop lies <eol> waiting the spring 's young resurrection day <eol> through the kind nurture of the winter cold <eol> nor seek thou by vain effort to revive <eol> the summer time , when roses were alive <eol> do thou thy work â€” be willing to be old <eol> thy sorrow is the husk that doth infold <eol> a gorgeous june , for which thou need'st not strive <eol>
