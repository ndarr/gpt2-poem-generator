o night and death , to whom we grudged him then <eol> when in man 's sight he stood not yet undone <eol> your king , your priest , your saviour , and your son <eol> we grudge not now , who know that not again <eol> shall this curse come upon the sins of men <eol> nor this face look upon the living sun <eol> that shall behold not so abhorred an one <eol> in all the days whereof his eye takes ken <eol> the bond is cancelled , and the prayer is heard <eol> that seemed so long but weak and wasted breath <eol> take him , for he is yours , o night and death <eol> hell yawns on him whose life was as a word <eol> uttered by death in hate of heaven and light <eol> a curse now dumb upon the lips of night <eol>
