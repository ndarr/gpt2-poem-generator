here , where peralta 's cattle used to stray <eol> here , where the spaniards in their early day <eol> rode , jingling , booted , spurred , nor ever guessed <eol> our race would own the land by them possessed <eol> here , where castilian bull fights left their stain <eol> of blood upon the soil of this new spain <eol> here , where old live oaks , spared till we condemn <eol> still wait within this city named for them <eol> we celebrate , with bombshell and with rhyme <eol> our noisiest day of days of yearly time <eol> o bare antonio 's hills that rim our sky <eol> antonio 's hills , that used to know july <eol> as but a time of sleep beneath the sun <eol> such days of languorous dreaming are all done <eol>
