if thou hadst built some mighty instrument <eol> and set thee down to utter ordered sound <eol> whose faithful billows , from thy hands unbound <eol> breaking in light , against our spirits went <eol> and caught , and bore above this earthly tent <eol> the far strayed back to their prime natal ground <eol> where all roots fast in harmony are found <eol> and god sits thinking out a pure consent <eol> nay , that thou couldst not ; that was not for thee <eol> our broken music thou must first restore <eol> a harder task than think thine own out free <eol> and till thou hast done it , no divinest score <eol> though rendered by thine own angelic choir <eol> can lift one human spirit from the mire <eol>
