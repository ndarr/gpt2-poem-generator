“ poor maiden ! ” thought the youth , “ if thou wert sent <eol> “ with thy soft lute and beauty 's blandishment <eol> “ to wake unholy wishes in this heart <eol> “ or tempt its truth , thou little know'st the art <eol> “ for tho ’ thy lips should sweetly counsel wrong <eol> “ those vestal eyes would disavow its song <eol> “ but thou hast breathed such purity , thy lay <eol> “ returns so fondly to youth 's virtuous day <eol> “ and leads thy soul — if e'er it wandered thence <eol> “ so gently back to its first innocence <eol> “ that i would sooner stop the unchained dove <eol> “ when swift returning to its home of love <eol> “ and round its snowy wing new fetters twine <eol> “ than turn from virtue one pure wish of thine <eol>
