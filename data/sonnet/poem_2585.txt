or dost thou mourn that the house of god <eol> has ceased to be a divine abode <eol> that the holy spirit , which erst did brood <eol> o'er the son of man by jordan 's flood <eol> in thine own pure form to the eye of sense <eol> from its resting place has departed hence <eol> and twitters the swallow , and wheels the bat <eol> o'er the mercy seat where its presence sat <eol> i have marked thy trembling breast , and heard <eol> with a heart responsive thy tones , sweet bird <eol> and have mourned , like thee , of earth 's fairest things <eol> the blight and the loss â€” oh ! had i thy wings <eol> from a world of woe to the realms of the blest <eol> i would flee away , and would be at rest <eol>
