sometimes in verse i praised , sometimes in verse sighed <eol> no more shall pen with love and beauty mell <eol> but to my heart alone my heart shall tell <eol> how unseen flames do burn it day and night <eol> lest flames give light , light bring my love to sight <eol> and my love prove my folly to excel <eol> wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell <eol> wherein is fire and yet there is no light <eol> for if one never loved like me , then why <eol> skill less blames he the thing he doth not know <eol> and he that so hath loved should favour show <eol> for he hath been a fool as well as i <eol> thus shall henceforth more pain , more folly have <eol> and folly past , may justly pardon crave <eol>
