i sing the pilgrim of a softer clime <eol> and milder speech than those brave men 's who brought <eol> to the ice and iron of our winter time <eol> a will as firm , a creed as stern , and wrought <eol> with one mailed hand , and with the other fought <eol> simply , as fits my theme , in homely rhyme <eol> i sing the blue eyed german spener taught <eol> through whose veiled , mystic faith the inward light <eol> steady and still , an easy brightness , shone <eol> transfiguring all things in its radiance white <eol> the garland which his meekness never sought <eol> i bring him ; over fields of harvest sown <eol> with seeds of blessing , now to ripeness grown <eol> i bid the sower pass before the reapers â€™ sight <eol>
