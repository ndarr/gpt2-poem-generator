they say that lonely sorrows do not chance <eol> i think it true , and that the cause i know <eol> a sorrow glideth in a funeral show <eol> easier than if it broke into a dance <eol> but i think too , that joy doth joy enhance <eol> as often as an added grief brings low <eol> and if keen eyed to see the flowers that grow <eol> as keen of nerve to feel the thorns that lance <eol> the foot that must walk naked in one way <eol> blest by the lily , white from toils and fears <eol> oftener than wounded by the thistle spears <eol> we should walk upright , bold , and earnest gay <eol> i 'll tell you how it fared with me one day <eol> after noon in a world , so called , of tears <eol>
