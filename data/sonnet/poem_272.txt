sole lord of lords and very king of kings <eol> he sits within the desert , carved in stone <eol> inscrutable , colossal , and alone <eol> and ancienter than memory of things <eol> graved on his front the sacred beetle clings <eol> disdain sits on his lips ; and in a frown <eol> scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown <eol> the affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings <eol> anear this presence . the long caravan 's <eol> dazed camels stop , and mute the bedouins stare <eol> this symbol of past power more than man 's <eol> presages doom . kings look â€” and kings despair <eol> their sceptres tremble in their jewelled hands <eol> and dark thrones totter in the baleful air <eol>
