let the sublimer muse , who , wrapp 'd in night <eol> rides on the raven pennons of the storm <eol> or o'er the field , with purple havoc warm <eol> lashes her steeds , and sings along the fight <eol> let her , whom more ferocious strains delight <eol> disdain the plaintive sonnet 's little form <eol> and scorn to its wild cadence to conform <eol> the impetuous tenor of her hardy flight <eol> but me , far lowest of the sylvan train <eol> who wake the wood nymphs from the forest shade <eol> with wildest song ;â€” me , much behoves thy aid <eol> of mingled melody , to grace my strain <eol> and give it power to please , as soft it flows <eol> through the smooth murmurs of thy frequent close <eol>
