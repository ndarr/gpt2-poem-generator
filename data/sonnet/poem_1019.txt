on ! leave the past to bury its own dead <eol> the past is naught to us , the present all <eol> what need of last year 's leaves to strew love 's bed <eol> what need of ghosts to grace a festival <eol> i would not , if i could , those days recall <eol> those days not ours . for us the feast is spread <eol> the lamps are lit , and music plays withal <eol> then let us love and leave the rest unsaid <eol> this island is our home . around it roar <eol> great gulfs and oceans , channels , straits and seas <eol> what matter in what wreck we reached the shore <eol> so we both reached it ? we can mock at these <eol> oh leave the past , if past indeed there be <eol> i would not know it ; i would know but thee <eol>
