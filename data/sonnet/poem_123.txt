man 's heel is on the almighty 's neck who said <eol> let there be hell , and there was hell — on earth <eol> but not for that may men forget their worth <eol> nay , but much more remember them — who led <eol> the living first from dwellings of the dead <eol> and rent the cerecloths that were wont to engirth <eol> souls wrapped and swathed and swaddled from their birth <eol> with lies that bound them fast from heel to head <eol> among the tombs when wise men all their lives <eol> dwelt , and cried out , and cut themselves with knives <eol> these men , being foolish , and of saints abhorred <eol> beheld in heaven the sun by saints reviled <eol> love , and on earth one everlasting lord <eol> in every likeness of a little child <eol>
