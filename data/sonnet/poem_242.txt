about a mile behind the viny banks <eol> how sweet it was , upon a sloping green <eol> sunspread , and shaded with a branching screen <eol> to lie in peace half murmuring words of thanks <eol> to see the mountains on each other climb <eol> with spaces for rich meadows flowery bright <eol> the winding river freshening the sight <eol> at intervals , the trees in leafy prime <eol> the distant village roofs of blue and white <eol> with intersections of quaint fashioned beams <eol> all slanting crosswise , and the feudal gleams <eol> of ruined turrets , barren in the light <eol> to watch the changing clouds , like clime in clime <eol> oh sweet to lie and bless the luxury of time <eol>
