my hope and heart is with thee â€” thou wilt be <eol> a latter luther , and a soldier priest <eol> to scare church harpies from the master 's feast <eol> our dusted velvets have much need of thee <eol> thou art no sabbath drawler of old saws <eol> distill 'd from some worm canker 'd homily <eol> but spurr 'd at heart with fieriest energy <eol> to embattail and to wall about thy cause <eol> with iron worded proof , hating to hark <eol> the humming of the drowsy pulpit drone <eol> half god 's good sabbath , while the worn out clerk <eol> brow beats his desk below . thou from a throne <eol> mounted in heaven wilt shoot into the dark <eol> arrows of lightnings . i will stand and mark <eol>
