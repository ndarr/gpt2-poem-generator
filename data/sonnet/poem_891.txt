since dark december shrouds the transient day <eol> and stormy winds are howling in their ire <eol> why com'st not thou , who always can'st inspire <eol> the soul of cheerfulness , and best array <eol> a sullen hour in smiles ?— o haste to pay <eol> the cordial visit sullen hours require <eol> around the circling walls a glowing fire <eol> shines ;— but it vainly shines in this delay <eol> to blend thy spirit 's warm promethean light <eol> come then , at science ’ , and at friendship 's call <eol> their vow 'd disciple ;— come , for they invite <eol> the social powers without thee languish all <eol> come , that i may not hear the winds of night <eol> nor count the heavy eave drops as they fall <eol>
