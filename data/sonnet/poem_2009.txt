ah ! who can e'er forget so fair a being <eol> who can forget her half retiring sweets <eol> god ! she is like a milk white lamb that bleats <eol> for man 's protection . surely the all seeing <eol> who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing <eol> will never give him pinions , who intreats <eol> such innocence to ruin ,â€” who vilely cheats <eol> a dove like bosom . in truth there is no freeing <eol> one 's thoughts from such a beauty ; when i hear <eol> a lay that once i saw her hand awake <eol> her form seems floating palpable , and near <eol> had i e'er seen her from an arbour take <eol> a dewy flower , oft would that hand appear <eol> and o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake <eol>
