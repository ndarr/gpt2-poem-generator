unhappy wit , like most mistaken things <eol> atones not for that envy which it brings <eol> in youth alone its empty praise we boast <eol> but soon the short lived vanity is lost <eol> like some fair flower the early spring supplies <eol> that gaily blooms , but even in blooming dies <eol> what is this wit , which must our cares employ <eol> the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy <eol> then most our trouble still when most admired <eol> and still the more we give , the more required <eol> whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease <eol> sure some to vex , but never all to please <eol> ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun <eol> by fools ‘ tis hated , and by knaves undone <eol>
