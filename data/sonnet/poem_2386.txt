life ! austere arbiter of each man 's fate <eol> by whom he learns that nature 's steadfast laws <eol> are as decrees immutable ; o pause <eol> your even forward march ! not yet too late <eol> teach me the needed lesson , when to wait <eol> inactive as a ship when no wind draws <eol> to stretch the loosened cordage . one implores <eol> thy clemency , whose wilfulness innate <eol> has gone uncurbed and roughshod while the years <eol> have lengthened into decades ; now distressed <eol> he knows no rule by which to move or stay <eol> and teased with restlessness and desperate fears <eol> he dares not watch in silence thy wise way <eol> bringing about results none could have guessed <eol>
