â€˜ man is of soul and body , formed for deeds <eol> of high resolve , on fancy 's boldest wing <eol> to soar unwearied , fearlessly to turn <eol> the keenest pangs to peacefulness , and taste <eol> the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield <eol> or he is formed for abjectness and woe <eol> to grovel on the dunghill of his fears <eol> to shrink at every sound , to quench the flame <eol> of natural love in sensualism , to know <eol> that hour as blessed when on his worthless days <eol> the frozen hand of death shall set its seal <eol> yet fear the cure , though hating the disease <eol> the one is man that shall hereafter be <eol> the other , man as vice has made him now <eol>
