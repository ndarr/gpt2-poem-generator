was this his coming ! i had hoped to see <eol> a scene of wondrous glory , as was told <eol> of some great god who in a rain of gold <eol> broke open bars and fell on danae <eol> or a dread vision as when semele <eol> sickening for love and unappeased desire <eol> prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire <eol> caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly <eol> with such glad dreams i sought this holy place <eol> and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand <eol> before this supreme mystery of love <eol> some kneeling girl with passionless pale face <eol> an angel with a lily in his hand <eol> and over both the white wings of a dove <eol>
