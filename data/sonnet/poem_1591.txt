shot up from broad rank blades that droop below <eol> the nodding wheat ear forms a graceful bow <eol> with milky kernels starting full , weigh 'd down <eol> ere yet the sun hath ting 'd its head with brown <eol> whilst thousands in a flock , for ever gay <eol> loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day <eol> and from the mazes of the leafy thorn <eol> drop one by one upon the bending corn <eol> giles with a pole assails their close retreats <eol> and round the grass grown dewy border beats <eol> on either side completely overspread <eol> here branches bend , there corn o'ertops his head <eol> green covert , hail ! for through the varying year <eol> no hours so sweet , no scene to him so dear <eol>
