blown in the morning , thou shalt fade ere noon <eol> what boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee <eol> thou'rt wondrous frolic , being to die so soon <eol> and passing proud a little color makes thee <eol> if thee thy brittle beauty so deceives <eol> know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane <eol> for the same beauty cloth , in bloody leaves <eol> the sentence of thy early death contain <eol> some clown 's coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower <eol> if by the careless plough thou shalt be torn <eol> and many herods lie in wait each hour <eol> to murder thee as soon as thou art born <eol> nay , force thy bud to blow â€” their tyrant breath <eol> anticipating life , to hasten death <eol>
