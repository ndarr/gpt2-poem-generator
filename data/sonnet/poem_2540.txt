since last i saw that countenance so mild <eol> slow stealing age , and a faint line of care <eol> had gently touched , methought , some features there <eol> yet looked the man as placid as a child <eol> and the same voice ,— whilst mingled with the throng <eol> unknowing , and unknown , we passed along <eol> that voice , a share of the brief time beguiled <eol> that voice i ne'er may hear again , i sighed <eol> at parting ,— wheresoe'er our various way <eol> in this great world ,— but from the banks of tweed <eol> as slowly sink the shades of eventide <eol> oh ! i shall hear the music of his reed <eol> far off , and thinking of that voice , shall say <eol> a blessing rest upon thy locks of gray <eol>
