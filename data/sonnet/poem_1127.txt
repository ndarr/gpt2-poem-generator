i 'd be concerned in no litigious jar <eol> beloved by all , not vainly popular <eol> whate'er assistance i had power to bring <eol> t â€™ oblige my company , or to serve my king <eol> whene'er they called , i 'd readily afford <eol> my tongue , my pen , my counsel , or my sword <eol> lawsuits i 'd shun , with as much studious care <eol> as i would dens where hungry lions are <eol> and rather put up injuries , than be <eol> a plague to him who 'd be a plague to me <eol> i value quiet at a price too great <eol> to give for my revenge so dear a rate <eol> for what do we by all our bustle gain <eol> but counterfeit delight for real pain <eol>
