fire out of heaven , a flower of perfect fire <eol> that where the roots of life are had its root <eol> and where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit <eol> a faith made flesh , a visible desire <eol> that heard the yet unbreathing years respire <eol> and speech break forth of centuries that sit mute <eol> beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit <eol> that touched the highest of hope , and went up higher <eol> a heart love wounded whereto love was law <eol> a soul reproachless without fear or flaw <eol> a shining spirit without shadow of shame <eol> a memory made of all men 's love and awe <eol> being disembodied , so thou be the same <eol> what need , o soul , to sign thee with thy name <eol>
