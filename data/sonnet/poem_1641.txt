o ye , who dwell in youth 's inviting bowers <eol> waste not , in useless joy , your fleeting hours <eol> but rather let the tears of sorrow roll <eol> and sad reflection fill the conscious soul <eol> for many a jocund spring has passed away <eol> and many a flower has blossomed , to decay <eol> and human life , still hastening to a close <eol> finds in the worthless dust its last repose <eol> still the vain world abounds in strife and hate <eol> and sire and son provoke each other 's fate <eol> and kindred blood by kindred hands is shed <eol> and vengeance sleeps not — dies not , with the dead <eol> all nature fades — the garden 's treasures fall <eol> young bud , and citron ripe — all perish , all <eol>
