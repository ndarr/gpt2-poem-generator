down in the redwood canyons cool and deep <eol> the shadows of the forest ever sleep <eol> the odorous redwoods , wet with fog and dew <eol> touch with the bay and mingle with the yew <eol> under the firs the red madrona shines <eol> the graceful tan oaks , fairest of them all <eol> lean lovingly unto the sturdy pines <eol> in whose far tops the birds of passage call <eol> here , where the forest shadows ever sleep <eol> the mountain lily lifts its chalice white <eol> the myriad ferns hang draperies soft and white <eol> thick on each mossy bank and watered steep <eol> where slender deer tread softly in the night <eol> down in the redwood canyons dark and deep <eol>
