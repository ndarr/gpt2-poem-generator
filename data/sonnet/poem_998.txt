thus , thus , o soul ! in that more awful hour <eol> when the last judgment 's darker shadows lower <eol> and , swift and stern , god 's messengers go forth <eol> to reap the harvest of this fated earth <eol> if then , on thee is found no crimson stain <eol> of god 's own lamb on bloody calvary slain <eol> if thou art resting not beneath the blood <eol> of that one sacrifice ordained of god <eol> where wilt thou fly ?— where hide thyself away <eol> from the dread reck'ning of the judgment day <eol> if resting ‘ neath the blood for sinners spilt <eol> look up !— the judge himself has borne thy guilt <eol> justice and judgement claim thy life in vain <eol> since christ , thy passover , himself is slain <eol>
