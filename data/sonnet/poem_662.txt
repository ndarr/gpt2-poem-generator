o daughter of pride , wasted with misery <eol> with all the glory that thy shame put on <eol> stripped off thy shame , o daughter of babylon <eol> yea , whoso be it , yea , happy shall he be <eol> that as thou hast served us hath rewarded thee <eol> blessed , who throweth against war 's boundary stone <eol> thy warrior brood , and breaketh bone by bone <eol> misrule thy son , thy daughter tyranny <eol> that landmark shalt thou not remove for shame <eol> but sitting down there in a widow 's weed <eol> wail ; for what fruit is now of thy red fame <eol> have thy sons too and daughters learnt indeed <eol> what thing it is to weep , what thing to bleed <eol> is it not thou that now art but a name ?
