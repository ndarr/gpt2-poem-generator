thou art a perfect sovereign , oh my god <eol> and i rejoice to think that thou art so <eol> that all events are under thy control <eol> and that thou knowest all i think and do <eol> but some may ask , â€œ then why am i to blame <eol> because i sin , if god hath made me thus <eol> stop , stop , my friend , god tempteth not to sin <eol> thou dost it of thy own free will and choice <eol> though god is sovereign , we free agents are <eol> accountable to him for all we do <eol> feel , think , or say ; and at the last great day <eol> a most exact account must render too <eol> with this conclusion be thou satisfied <eol> for all who will accept him , christ hath died <eol>
