if in the spirit glows no spark divine <eol> if soulless dust return to dust again <eol> if , after life , but death and dark remain <eol> then it were well to make the moment thine <eol> bacchante steeping soul and sense in wine <eol> in lotus lulling languors , fond desires <eol> that heat the heart with fierce , unhallowed fires <eol> till pleasure , circe like , transform us into swine <eol> but if some subtler spirit thrill our clay <eol> some god like flame illume this fleeting dust <eol> promethean fire snatched from the olympian height <eol> then must we choose the nobler , higher way <eol> seeking the beautiful , the pure , the just <eol> the ultimate crowned triumph of the right <eol>
