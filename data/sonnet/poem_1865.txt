when i 've eat my fill and my belt is snug <eol> i begin to think of my baccy plug <eol> i whittle a fill in my horny palm <eol> and the bowl of me old clay pipe i cram <eol> i trim the edges , i tamp it down <eol> i nurse a light with an anxious frown <eol> i begin to draw , and my cheeks tuck in <eol> and all my face is a blissful grin <eol> and up in a cloud the good smoke goes <eol> and the good pipe glimmers and fades and glows <eol> in its throat it chuckles a cheery song <eol> for i likes it hot and i likes it strong <eol> oh , it 's good is grub when you 're feeling hollow <eol> but the best of a meal 's the smoke to follow <eol>
