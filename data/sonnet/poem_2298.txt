looking far foorth into the ocean wide <eol> a goodly ship with banners bravely dight <eol> and flag in her top gallant , i espide <eol> through the maine sea making her merry flight <eol> faire blewe the wind into her bosome right <eol> and th'heavens looked lovely all the while <eol> that she did seeme to daunce , as in delight <eol> and at her owne felicitie did smile <eol> all sodainely there clove unto her keele <eol> a little fish that men call remora <eol> which stopt her course , and held her by the heele <eol> that winde nor tide could move her thence away <eol> straunge thing me seemeth , that so small a thing <eol> should able be so great an one to wring <eol>
