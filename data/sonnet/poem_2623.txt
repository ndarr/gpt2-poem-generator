pensive within the coliseum 's walls <eol> i stood with thee , o poet of the west <eol> the day when each had been a welcome guest <eol> in san clemente 's venerable halls <eol> with what delight my memory now recalls <eol> that hour of hours , that flower of all the rest <eol> when , with thy white beard falling on thy breast <eol> that noble head , that well might serve as paul 's <eol> in some divinest vision of the saint <eol> by raffael dreamed â€” i heard thee mourn the dead <eol> the martyred host who fearless there , though faint <eol> walked the rough road that up to heaven 's gate led <eol> these were the pictures calderon loved to paint <eol> in golden hues that here perchance have fled <eol>
