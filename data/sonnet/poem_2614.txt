my god , my god , how much i love my goddess <eol> whose virtues rare , unto the heavens arise <eol> my god , my god , how much i love her eyes <eol> one shining bright , the other full of hardness <eol> my god , my god , how much i love her wisdom <eol> whose works may ravish heaven 's richest maker <eol> of whose eyes â€™ joys if i might be partaker <eol> then to my soul a holy rest would come <eol> my god , how much i love to hear her speak <eol> whose hands i kiss and ravished oft rekisseth <eol> when she stands wotless whom so much she blesseth <eol> say then , what mind this honest love would break <eol> since her perfections pure , withouten blot <eol> makes her beloved of thee , she knoweth not <eol>
