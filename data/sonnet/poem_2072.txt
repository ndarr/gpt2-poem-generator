this door you might not open , and you did <eol> so enter now , and see for what slight thing <eol> you are betrayed . . . . here is no treasure hid <eol> no cauldron , no clear crystal mirroring <eol> the sought for truth , no heads of women slain <eol> for greed like yours , no writhings of distress <eol> but only what you see . . . . look yet again <eol> an empty room , cobwebbed and comfortless <eol> yet this alone out of my life i kept <eol> unto myself , lest any know me quite <eol> and you did so profane me when you crept <eol> unto the threshold of this room to night <eol> that i must never more behold your face <eol> this now is yours . i seek another place <eol>
