where dim the ethereal eye , no art , though clear <eol> as golden star in morning 's amber springs <eol> can pierce the fogs of low imaginings <eol> painting and sculpture are a mockery mere <eol> where dull to deafness is the hearing ear <eol> vain is the poet . nought but earthly things <eol> have credence . when the soaring skylark sings <eol> how shall the stony statue strain to hear <eol> open the deaf ear , wake the sleeping eye <eol> and lo , musicians , painters , poets â€” all <eol> trooping instinctive , come without a call <eol> as winds that where they list blow evermore <eol> as waves from silent deserts roll to die <eol> in mighty voices on the peopled shore <eol>
