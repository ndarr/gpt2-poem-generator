throughout the echoing chambers of my brain <eol> i hear your words in mournful cadence toll <eol> like some slow passing bell which warns the soul <eol> of sundering darkness . unrelenting , fain <eol> to batter down resistance , fall again <eol> stroke after stroke , insistent diastole <eol> the bitter blows of truth , until the whole <eol> is hammered into fact made strangely plain <eol> where shall i look for comfort ? not to you <eol> our worlds are drawn apart , our spirit 's suns <eol> divided , and the light of mine burnt dim <eol> now in the haunted twilight i must do <eol> your will . i grasp the cup which over runs <eol> and with my trembling lips i touch the rim <eol>
