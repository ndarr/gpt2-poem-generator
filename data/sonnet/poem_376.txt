what human form is this ? what form divine <eol> and who are these that gaze upon his face <eol> mild , beautiful , and full of heavenly grace <eol> with whose reflected light the gazers shine <eol> saviour , who does not know it to be thine <eol> who does not long to fill a gazer 's place <eol> and yet there is no time , there is no space <eol> to keep away thy servants from thy shrine <eol> here if we kneel , and watch with faithful eyes <eol> thou art not too far for faithful eyes to see <eol> thou art not too far to turn and look on me <eol> to speak to me , and to receive my sighs <eol> therefore for ever i forget the skies <eol> and find an everlasting sun in thee <eol>
