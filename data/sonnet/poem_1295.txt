when old jack died , it seemed a human friend <eol> had suddenly gone from us ; that some face <eol> that we had loved to fondle and embrace <eol> from babyhood , no more would condescend <eol> to smile on us forever . we might bend <eol> with tearful eyes above him , interlace <eol> our chubby fingers o'er him , romp and race <eol> plead with him , call and coax — aye , we might send <eol> the old halloo up for him , whistle , hist <eol> ( if sobs had let us ) or , as wildly vain <eol> snapped thumbs , called “ speak , ” and he had not replied <eol> we might have gone down on our knees and kissed <eol> the tousled ears , and yet they must remain <eol> deaf , motionless , we knew — when old jack died <eol>
