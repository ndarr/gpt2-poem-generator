we are ambitious overmuch in life <eol> straining at ends of hard accomplishment <eol> and goaded onward by poor discontent <eol> we build our little babels up through strife <eol> and bitterness of soul , and motions rife <eol> with passions that oft slay the innocent <eol> like priests of lust plunging the cruel knife <eol> into the victims of their wilderment <eol> not thus do thou , but with a patient hand <eol> place thou thine acorn in the fertile soil <eol> labouring ever with unhurtful toil <eol> and cheerful hope until the seed expand <eol> grow with the strength of truth , and ripening time <eol> and stand at last in majesty sublime <eol>
