unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty <eol> runs this poor river , charged with streams of zeal <eol> returning thee the tribute of my duty <eol> which here my love , my youth , my plaints reveal <eol> here i unclasp the book of my charged soul <eol> where i have cast th â€™ accounts of all my care <eol> here have i summed my sighs . here i enrol <eol> how they were spent for thee . look , what they are <eol> look on the dear expenses of my youth <eol> and see how just i reckon with thine eyes <eol> examine well thy beauty with my truth <eol> and cross my cares ere greater sums arise <eol> read it , sweet maid , though it be done but slightly <eol> who can show all his love , doth love but lightly <eol>
