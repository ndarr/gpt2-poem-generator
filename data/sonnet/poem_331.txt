if only in dreams may man be fully blest <eol> is heaven a dream ? is she i clasped a dream <eol> or stood she here even now where dewdrops gleam <eol> and miles of furze shine golden down the west <eol> i seem to clasp her still — still on my breast <eol> her bosom beats ,— i see the blue eyes beam <eol> i think she kissed these lips , for now they seem <eol> scarce mine : so hallowed of the lips they pressed <eol> yon thicket 's breath — can that be eglantine <eol> those birds — can they be morning 's choristers <eol> can this be earth ? can these be banks of furze <eol> like burning bushes fired of god they shine <eol> i seem to know them , though this body of mine <eol> passed into spirit at the touch of hers <eol>
