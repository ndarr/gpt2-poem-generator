and thou , my village ! as again i tread <eol> amidst thy living and above thy dead <eol> though some fair playmates guard with charter fears <eol> their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years <eol> though with the dust some reverend locks may blend <eol> where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end <eol> on every bud the changing year recalls <eol> the brightening glance of morning memory falls <eol> still following onward as the months unclose <eol> the balmy lilac or the bridal rose <eol> and still shall follow , till they sink once more <eol> beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore <eol> as when my bark , long tossing in the gale <eol> furled in her port her tempest rended sail <eol>
