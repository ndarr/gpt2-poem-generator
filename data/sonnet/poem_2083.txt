the old house totters ‘ neath its weight of years <eol> bowed , like the form of him who shelters there <eol> old , friendless , lone — save for the wanton , care <eol> who flouts him , mocks his grief with gibes and jeers <eol> and laughs to see his piteous hopes grow fears <eol> not his the joy of placid , sun crowned age <eol> his dim eyes falter as he scans the page <eol> of life 's worn album , blotted with his tears <eol> he sees in dreams the wife he loved — long dead <eol> the son — once proud to bear his father 's name <eol> who mixed his honest blood with dire disgrace <eol> the wayward girl who wrought her father shame <eol> he sits alone with care ; the day has fled <eol> and twilight falls , upon the furrowed face <eol>
