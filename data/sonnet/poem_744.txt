since fate relentless stopp 'd their heavenly voice <eol> no more the forests ring , or groves rejoice <eol> who now shall charm the shades , where cowley strung <eol> his living harp , and lofty denham sung <eol> but hark ! the groves rejoice , the forest rings <eol> are these revived ? or is it granville sings <eol> â€˜ tis yours , my lord , to bless our soft retreats <eol> and call the muses to their ancient seats <eol> to paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes <eol> to crown the forest with immortal greens <eol> make windsor hills in lofty numbers rise <eol> and lift her turrets nearer to the skies <eol> to sing those honours you deserve to wear <eol> and add new lustre to her silver star <eol>
