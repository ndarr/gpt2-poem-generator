i had forgotten what i had lightly said <eol> and without speech , without a thought i went <eol> steeped in that golden quiet , all content <eol> to drink the transient beauty as it sped <eol> out of eternal darkness into time <eol> to light and burn and know itself a fire <eol> yet doomed â€” ah , fate of the fulfilled desire <eol> to fade , a meteor , paying for the crime <eol> of living glorious in the denser air <eol> of our material earth . a strange despair <eol> an agony , yet strangely , subtly sweet <eol> and tender as an unpassionate caress <eol> filled me ... oh laughter ! youth 's conceit <eol> grown almost conscious of youth 's feebleness <eol>
