our love is not a fading , earthly flower <eol> its wing è d seed dropped down from paradise <eol> and , nursed by day and night , by sun and shower <eol> doth momently to fresher beauty rise <eol> to us the leafless autumn is not bare <eol> nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green <eol> our summer hearts make summer 's fulness , where <eol> no leaf , or bud , or blossom may be seen <eol> for nature 's life in love 's deep life doth lie <eol> love ,— whose forgetfulness is beauty 's death <eol> whose mystic key these cells of thou and i <eol> into the infinite freedom openeth <eol> and makes the body 's dark and narrow grate <eol> the wide flung leaves of heaven 's own palace gate <eol>
