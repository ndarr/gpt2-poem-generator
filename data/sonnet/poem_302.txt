when all the hungry pain of love i bear <eol> and in poor lightless thought but burn and burn <eol> and wit goes hunting wisdom everywhere <eol> yet can no word of revelation learn <eol> when endlessly the scales of yea and nay <eol> in dreadful motion fall and rise and fall <eol> when all my heart in sorrow i could pay <eol> until at last were left no tear at all <eol> then if with tame or subtle argument <eol> companions come and draw me to a place <eol> where words are but the tappings of content <eol> and life spreads all her garments with a grace <eol> i curse that ease , and hunger in my heart <eol> back to my pain and lonely to depart <eol>
