o queenly month of indolent repose <eol> i drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume <eol> as in thy downy lap of clover bloom <eol> i nestle like a drowsy child and doze <eol> the lazy hours away . the zephyr throws <eol> the shifting shuttle of the summer 's loom <eol> and weaves a damask work of gleam and gloom <eol> before thy listless feet . the lily blows <eol> a bugle call of fragrance o'er the glade <eol> and wheeling into ranks , with plume and spear <eol> thy harvest armies gather on parade <eol> while faint and far away , yet pure and clear <eol> a voice calls out of alien lands of shade <eol> all hail the peerless goddess of the year <eol>
