â€˜ tis gross to squander hundreds upon fish <eol> yet pen them cooked within too small a dish <eol> so too it turns the stomach , if there sticks <eol> dirt to the bowl wherein your wine you mix <eol> or if the servant , who behind you stands <eol> has fouled the beaker with his greasy hands <eol> brooms , dish cloths , saw dust , what a mite they cost <eol> neglect them though , your reputation 's lost <eol> what ? sweep with dirty broom a floor inlaid <eol> spread unwashed cloths o'er tapestry and brocade <eol> forgetting , sure , the less such things entail <eol> of care and cost , the more the shame to fail <eol> worse than fall short in luxuries , which one sees <eol> at no man 's table but your rich grandees <eol>
