maintain your post : that 's all the fame you need <eol> for â€˜ tis impossible you should proceed <eol> already i am worn with cares and age <eol> and just abandoning the ungrateful stage <eol> unprofitably kept at heaven 's expense <eol> i live a rent charge on his providence <eol> but you , whom every muse and grace adorn <eol> whom i foresee to better fortune born <eol> be kind to my remains ; and o defend <eol> against your judgment , your departed friend <eol> let not the insulting foe my fame pursue <eol> but shade those laurels which descend to you <eol> and take for tribute what these lines express <eol> you merit more ; nor could my love do less <eol>
