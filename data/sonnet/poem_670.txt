i shall forget you presently , my dear <eol> so make the most of this , your little day <eol> your little month , your little half a year <eol> ere i forget , or die , or move away <eol> and we are done forever ; by and by <eol> i shall forget you , as i said , but now <eol> if you entreat me with your loveliest lie <eol> i will protest you with my favorite vow <eol> i would indeed that love were longer lived <eol> and oaths were not so brittle as they are <eol> but so it is , and nature has contrived <eol> to struggle on without a break thus far <eol> whether or not we find what we are seeking <eol> is idle , biologically speaking <eol>
