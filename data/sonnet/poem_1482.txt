i must not grieve , my love , whose eyes would read <eol> lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile <eol> flowers have time before they come to seed <eol> and she is young , and now must sport the while <eol> and sport , sweet maid , in season of these years <eol> and learn to gather flowers before they wither <eol> and where the sweetest blossom first appears <eol> let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither <eol> lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air <eol> and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise <eol> pity and smiles do best become the fair <eol> pity and smiles must only yield thee praise <eol> make me to say , when all my griefs are gone <eol> happy the heart that sigh 'd for such a one <eol>
