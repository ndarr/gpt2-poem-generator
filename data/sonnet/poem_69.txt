give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs <eol> the ponderous undertones of â€˜ bus and tram <eol> a garret and a glimpse across the roofs <eol> of clouds blown eastward over notre dame <eol> the glad eyed streets and radiant gatherings <eol> where i drank deep the bliss of being young <eol> the strife and sweet potential flux of things <eol> i sought youth 's dream of happiness among <eol> it walks here aureoled with the city light <eol> forever through the myriad featured mass <eol> flaunting not far its fugitive embrace <eol> heard sometimes in a song across the night <eol> caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass <eol> and when love yields to love seen face to face <eol>
