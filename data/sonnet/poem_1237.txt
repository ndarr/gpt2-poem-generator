what scenes appear where'er i turn my view <eol> the dear ideas , where i fly , pursue <eol> rise in the grove , before the altar rise <eol> stain all my soul , and wanton in my eyes <eol> i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee <eol> thy image steals between my god and me <eol> thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear <eol> with every bead i drop too soft a tear <eol> when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll <eol> and swelling organs lift the rising soul <eol> one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight <eol> priests , tapers , temples , swim before my sight <eol> in seas of flame my plunging soul is drown 'd <eol> while altars blaze , and angels tremble round <eol>
