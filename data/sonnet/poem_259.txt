how languisheth the primrose of love 's garden <eol> how trill her tears , th ’ elixir of my senses <eol> ambitious sickness , what doth thee so harden <eol> oh spare , and plague thou me for her offences <eol> ah roses , love 's fair roses , do not languish <eol> blush through the milk white veil that holds you covered <eol> if heat or cold may mitigate your anguish <eol> i 'll burn , i 'll freeze , but you shall be recovered <eol> good god , would beauty mark now she is crased <eol> how but one shower of sickness makes her tender <eol> her judgments then to mark my woes amazed <eol> to mercy should opinion 's fort surrender <eol> and i ,— oh would i might , or would she meant it <eol> should hery [ a ] love , who now in heart lament it <eol>
