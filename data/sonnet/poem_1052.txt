after the fierce midsummer all ablaze <eol> has burned itself to ashes , and expires <eol> in the intensity of its own fires <eol> there come the mellow , mild , st. martin days <eol> crowned with the calm of peace , but sad with haze <eol> so after love has led us , till he tires <eol> of his own throes and torments and desires <eol> comes large eyed friendship : with a restful gaze <eol> he beckons us to follow , and across <eol> cool , verdant vales we wander free from care <eol> is it a touch of frost lies in the air <eol> why are we haunted with a sense of loss <eol> we do not wish the pain back , or the heat <eol> and yet , and yet , these days are incomplete <eol>
