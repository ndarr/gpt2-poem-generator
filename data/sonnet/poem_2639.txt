be it not mine to steal the cultured flower <eol> from any garden of the rich and great <eol> nor seek with care , through many a weary hour <eol> some novel form of wonder to create <eol> enough for me the leafy woods to rove <eol> and gather simple cups of morning dew <eol> or , in the fields and meadows that i love <eol> find beauty in their bells of every hue <eol> thus round my cottage floats a fragrant air <eol> and though the rustic plot be humbly laid <eol> yet , like the lilies gladly growing there <eol> i have not toiled , but take what god has made <eol> my lord ambition passed , and smiled in scorn <eol> i plucked a rose , and , lo ! it had no thorn <eol>
