mine eyes are filled today with old amaze <eol> at mountains , and at meadows deftly strewn <eol> with bits of the gay jewelry of june <eol> and of her splendid vesture ; and , agaze <eol> i stand where spring her bright brocade of days <eol> embroidered o'er , and listen to the flow <eol> of sudden runlets â€” the faint blasts they blow <eol> low , on their stony bugles , in still ways <eol> for wonders are at one , confederate yet <eol> yea , where the wearied year came to a close <eol> an odor reminiscent of the rose <eol> and everywhere her seal has summer set <eol> and , as of old , in the horizon sky <eol> the sun can find a lovely place to die <eol>
