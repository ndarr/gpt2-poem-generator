but i have seen pictures the work of man <eol> in which at first appeared but chaos wild <eol> so high the art transcended , they beguiled <eol> the eye as formless , and without a plan <eol> not soon , the spirit , brooding o'er , began <eol> to see a purpose rise , like mountain isled <eol> when god said , let the dry appear ! and , piled <eol> above the waves , it rose in twilight wan <eol> so might thy pictures then have been too strange <eol> for us to pierce beyond their outmost look <eol> a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book <eol> an atmosphere too high for wings to range <eol> and so we could but , gazing , pale and change <eol> and tremble as at a void thought cannot brook <eol>
