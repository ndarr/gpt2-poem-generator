vanity of vanities , the preacher saith <eol> all things are vanity . the eye and ear <eol> cannot be filled with what they see and hear <eol> like early dew , or like the sudden breath <eol> of wind , or like the grass that withereth <eol> is man , tossed to and fro by hope and fear <eol> so little joy hath he , so little cheer <eol> till all things end in the long dust of death <eol> to day is still the same as yesterday <eol> to morrow also even as one of them <eol> and there is nothing new under the sun <eol> until the ancient race of time be run <eol> the old thorns shall grow out of the old stem <eol> and morning shall be cold and twilight grey <eol>
