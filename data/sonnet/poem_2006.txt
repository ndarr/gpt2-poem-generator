dear heart and love ! what happiness to sit <eol> and watch the firelight 's varying shade and shine <eol> on thy young face ; and through those eyes of thine <eol> as through glad windows — mark fair fancies flit <eol> in sumptuous chambers of thy soul 's chaste wit <eol> like graceful women : then to take in mine <eol> thy hand , whose pressure brims my heart 's divine <eol> hushed rapture as with music exquisite <eol> when i remember how thy look and touch <eol> sway , like the moon , my blood with ecstasy <eol> i dare not think to what fierce heaven might lead <eol> thy soft embrace ; or in thy kiss how much <eol> sweet hell ,— beyond all help of me ,— might be <eol> where i were lost , where i were lost indeed <eol>
