as to a child , i talked my heart asleep <eol> with empty promise of the coming day <eol> and it slept rather for my words made sleep <eol> than from a thought of what their sense did say <eol> for did it care for sense , would it not wake <eol> and question closer to the morrow ’ s pleasure <eol> would it not edge nearer my words , to take <eol> the promise in the meting of its measure <eol> so , if it slept , ’ twas that it cared but for <eol> the present sleepy use of promised joy <eol> thanking the fruit but for the forecome flower <eol> which the less active senses best enjoy <eol> thus with deceit do i detain the heart <eol> of which deceit ’ s self knows itself a part <eol>
