passing i saw her as she stood beside <eol> a lonely stream between two barren wolds <eol> her loose vest hung in rudely gathered folds <eol> on her swart bosom , which in maiden pride <eol> pillowed a string of pearls ; among her hair <eol> twined the light bluebell and the stone crop gay <eol> and not far thence the small encampment lay <eol> curling its wreathed smoke into the air <eol> she seemed a child of some sun favored clime <eol> so still , so habited to warmth and rest <eol> and in my wayward musings on past time <eol> when my thought fills with treasured memories <eol> that image nearest borders on the blest <eol> creations of pure art that never dies <eol>
