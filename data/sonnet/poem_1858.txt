he knows the sweet vexation in the strife <eol> of love with time , this bard who fain would stray <eol> to fairer place beyond the storms of life <eol> with astral faces near him day by day <eol> in deep mossed dells the mellow waters flow <eol> which best he loves ; for there the echoes , rife <eol> with rich suggestions of his long ago <eol> astarte , pass with thee ! and , far away <eol> dear southern seasons haunt the dreamy eye <eol> spring , flower zoned , and summer , warbling low <eol> in tasselled corn , alternate come and go <eol> while gypsy autumn , splashed from heel to thigh <eol> with vine blood , treads the leaves ; and , halting nigh <eol> wild winter bends across a beard of snow <eol>
