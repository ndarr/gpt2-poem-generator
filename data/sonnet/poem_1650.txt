the spring returns ! what matters then that war <eol> on the horizon like a beacon burns <eol> that death ascends , man 's most desired star <eol> that darkness is his hope ? the spring returns <eol> triumphant through the wider arched cope <eol> she comes , she comes , unto her tyranny <eol> and at her coronation are set ope <eol> the prisons of the mind , and man is free <eol> the beggar garbed or over bent with snows <eol> each mortal , long defeated , disallowed <eol> feeling her touch , grows stronger limbed , and knows <eol> the purple on his shoulders and is proud <eol> the spring returns ! o madness beyond sense <eol> breed in our bones thine own omnipotence <eol>
