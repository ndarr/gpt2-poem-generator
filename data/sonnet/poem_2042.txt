thou yellow trumpeter of laggard spring <eol> thou herald of rich summer 's myriad flowers <eol> the climbing sun with new recovered powers <eol> does warm thee into being , through the ring <eol> of rich , brown earth he woos thee , makes thee fling <eol> thy green shoots up , inheriting the dowers <eol> of bending sky and sudden , sweeping showers <eol> till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing <eol> to make all nature glad , thou art so gay <eol> to fill the lonely with a joy untold <eol> nodding at every gust of wind to day <eol> to morrow jewelled with raindrops . always bold <eol> to stand erect , full in the dazzling play <eol> of april 's sun , for thou hast caught his gold <eol>
