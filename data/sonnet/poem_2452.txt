great truths are portions of the soul of man <eol> great souls are portions of eternity <eol> each drop of blood that e'er through true heart ran <eol> with lofty message , ran for thee and me <eol> for god 's law , since the starry song began <eol> hath been , and still forevermore must be <eol> that every deed which shall outlast time 's span <eol> must spur the soul to be erect and free <eol> slave is no word of deathless lineage sprung <eol> too many noble souls have thought and died <eol> too many mighty poets lived and sung <eol> and our good saxon , from lips purified <eol> with martyr fire , throughout the world hath rung <eol> too long to have god 's holy cause denied <eol>
