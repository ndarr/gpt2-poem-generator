there is a race which cold , ungenial skies <eol> breed from decay , as fungous growths arise <eol> though dying fast , yet springing fast again <eol> which still usurps an unsubstantial reign <eol> with frames too languid for the charms of sense <eol> and minds worn down with action too intense <eol> tired of a world whose joys they never knew <eol> themselves deceived , yet thinking all untrue <eol> scarce men without , and less than girls within <eol> sick of their life before its cares begin <eol> the dull disease , which drains their feeble hearts <eol> to life 's decay some hectic thrill 's imparts <eol> and lends a force which , like the maniac 's power <eol> pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour <eol>
