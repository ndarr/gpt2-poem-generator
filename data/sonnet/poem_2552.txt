woe for thee , babylon !— thy men of might <eol> shall fall unhonoured in the sanguine fight <eol> like the chased roe thy hosts disordered fly <eol> and those who turn to strive but turn to die <eol> thy young men tremble and thy maids grow pale <eol> and swell with frantic grief thy funeral wail <eol> they kneel for mercy , but they sue in vain <eol> their beauty withers on the gore dyed plain <eol> with fathers , lovers , brothers , meet their doom <eol> and ‘ mid thy blackened ruins find a tomb <eol> of fear unconscious , in soft slumbers blest <eol> the infant dies upon its mother 's breast <eol> unpitied e'en by her — the hand that gave <eol> the blow has sent the parent to the grave <eol>
