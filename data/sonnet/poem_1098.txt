the winter wind is raving fierce and shrill <eol> and chides with angry moan the frosty skies <eol> the white stars gaze with sleepless gorgon eyes <eol> that freeze the earth in terror fixed and still <eol> we reck not of the wild night 's gloom and chill <eol> housed from its rage , dear friend ; and fancy flies <eol> lured by the hand of beckoning memories <eol> back to those summer evenings on the hill <eol> where we together watched the sun go down <eol> beyond the gold washed uplands , while his fires <eol> touched into glittering life the vanes and spires <eol> piercing the purpling mists that veiled the town <eol> the wintry night thy voice and eyes beguile <eol> till wake the sleeping summers in thy smile <eol>
