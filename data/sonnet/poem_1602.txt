there was a day when death to me meant tears <eol> and tearful takings leave that had to be <eol> and awed embarkings on an unshored sea <eol> and sudden disarrangement of the years <eol> but now i know that nothing interferes <eol> with the fixed forces when a tired man dies <eol> that death is only answerings and replies <eol> the chiming of a bell which no one hears <eol> the casual slanting of a half spent sun <eol> the soft recessional of noise and coil <eol> the coveted something time nor age can spoil <eol> i know it is a fabric finely spun <eol> between the stars and dark ; to seize and keep <eol> such glad romances as we read in sleep <eol>
