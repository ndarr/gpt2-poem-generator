what better tale could any lover tell <eol> when age or death his reckoning shall write <eol> than thus , ‘ love taught me only to rebel <eol> against these things ,— the thieving of delight <eol> without return ; the gospellers of fear <eol> who , loving , yet deny the truth they bear <eol> sad suited lusts with lecherous hands to smear <eol> the cloth of gold they would but dare not wear <eol> and love gave me great knowledge of the trees <eol> and singing birds , and earth with all her flowers <eol> wisdom i knew and righteousness in these <eol> i lived in their atonement all my hours <eol> love taught me how to beauty 's eye alone <eol> the secret of the lying heart is known <eol>
