rise from your gory ashes stern and pale <eol> ye martyred thousands ! and with dreadful ire <eol> a voice of doom , a front of gloomy fire <eol> rebuke those faithless souls , whose querulous wail <eol> disturbs your sacred sleep !— “ the withering hail <eol> of battle , hunger , pestilence , despair <eol> whatever of mortal anguish man may bear <eol> we bore unmurmuring ! strengthened by the mail <eol> of a most holy purpose !— then we died <eol> vex not our rest by cries of selfish pain <eol> but to the noblest measure of your powers <eol> endure the appointed trial ! griefs defied <eol> but launch their threatening thunderbolts in vain <eol> and angry storms pass by in gentlest showers <eol>
