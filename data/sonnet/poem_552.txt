look in my face ; my name is might have been <eol> i am also called no more , too late , farewell <eol> unto thine ear i hold the dead sea shell <eol> cast up thy life 's foam fretted feet between <eol> unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen <eol> which had life 's form and love 's , but by my spell <eol> is now a shaken shadow intolerable <eol> of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen <eol> mark me , how still i am ! but should there dart <eol> one moment through thy soul the soft surprise <eol> of that winged peace which lulls the breath of sighs <eol> then shalt thou see me smile , and turn apart <eol> thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart <eol> sleepless with cold commemorative eyes <eol>
