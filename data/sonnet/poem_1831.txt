i watched them long in my curious dream <eol> till they stood by the borders of the stream <eol> then , just as i thought , the two ways met <eol> but all the brethren were talking yet <eol> and would talk on , till the heaving tide <eol> carried them over , side by side <eol> side by side , for the way was one <eol> the toilsome journey of life was done <eol> and priest and quaker , and all who died <eol> came out alike on the other side <eol> no forms , or crosses , or books had they <eol> no gowns of silk , or suits of gray <eol> no creeds to guide them , or mss <eol> for all had put on christ 's righteousness <eol>
