has she forgotten ? on this very may <eol> we were to meet here , with the birds and bees <eol> as on that sabbath , underneath the trees <eol> we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away <eol> the vines from these old granites , cold and gray <eol> and yet indeed not grim enough were they <eol> to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies <eol> or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies <eol> has she forgotten — that the may has won <eol> its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree <eol> are sprayed above the grasses as the sun <eol> might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly <eol> has she forgotten life — love — everyone <eol> has she forgotten me — forgotten me <eol>
