but ah , those leaves !— it was not summer 's mouth <eol> breathed such a gold upon them . and look there <eol> that beech how red ! see , through its boughs , half bare <eol> how low the sun lies in the mid day south <eol> the sweetness is but one pined memory flown <eol> back from our summer , wandering alone <eol> see , see the dead leaves falling ! hear thy heart <eol> which , with the year 's pulse beating swift or slow <eol> takes in the changing world its changing part <eol> return a sigh , an echo sad and low <eol> to the faint , scarcely audible sound <eol> with which the leaf goes whispering to the ground <eol> o love , sad winter lieth at the door <eol> behind sad winter , age — we know no more <eol>
