this life is full of numbness and of balk <eol> of haltingness and baffled short coming <eol> of promise unfulfilled , of everything <eol> that is puffed vanity and empty talk <eol> its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk <eol> its very song bird trails a broken wing <eol> its very spring is not indeed like spring <eol> but sighs like autumn round an aimless walk <eol> this life we live is dead for all its breath <eol> death 's self it is , set off on pilgrimage <eol> travelling with tottering steps the first short stage <eol> the second stage is one mere desert dust <eol> where death sits veiled amid creation 's rust <eol> unveil thy face , o death who art not death <eol>
