‘ here let us walk , ’ he said , ‘ observed by none <eol> conscious of pleasures to the world unknown <eol> so may my soul have joy , as thou , my wife <eol> art far the dearest solace of my life <eol> and rather would i choose , by heaven above <eol> to die this instant , than to lose thy love <eol> reflect what truth was in my passion shown <eol> when , unendow 'd , i took thee for my own <eol> and sought no treasure but thy heart alone <eol> old as i am , and now deprived of sight <eol> whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight <eol> nor age , nor blindness rob me of delight <eol> each other loss with patience i can bear <eol> the loss of thee is what i only fear <eol>
