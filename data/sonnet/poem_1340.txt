thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay <eol> repair me now , for now mine end doth haste <eol> i run to death , and death meets me as fast <eol> and all my pleasures are like yesterday <eol> i dare not move my dim eyes any way <eol> despair behind , and death before , doth cast <eol> such terror , and my feeble flesh doth waste <eol> by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh <eol> only thou art above , and when towards thee <eol> by thy leave i can look , i rise again <eol> but our old subtle foe so tempteth me <eol> that not one hour myself i can sustain <eol> thy grace may wing me to prevent his art <eol> and thou , like adamant , draw mine iron heart <eol>
