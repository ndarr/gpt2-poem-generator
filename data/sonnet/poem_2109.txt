then round me , on the light wind softly borne <eol> i heard the numbers of an unseen harp <eol> and turning , saw an angel near me stand <eol> he sang of earthly love , and the soft tones <eol> of his sweet harp were like aeolian strains <eol> far breathing o'er some blissful eden world <eol> and as i listened , all my holiest dreams <eol> of harmony , ideal , grand , and high <eol> seem 'd discord . then methought i saw <eol> upon the morning hills , a bower arise <eol> bright flowers of wondrous hues around it bloomed <eol> all , all of beauty that the heart could dream <eol> was there ; and , lov'lier far than all <eol> a sweet eyed maiden , twining rose wreaths fair <eol>
