i stand again on the familiar shore <eol> and hear the waves of the distracted sea <eol> piteously calling and lamenting thee <eol> and waiting restless at thy cottage door <eol> the rocks , the sea weed on the ocean floor <eol> the willows in the meadow , and the free <eol> wild winds of the atlantic welcome me <eol> then why shouldst thou be dead , and come no more <eol> ah , why shouldst thou be dead , when common men <eol> are busy with their trivial affairs <eol> having and holding ? why , when thou hadst read <eol> nature 's mysterious manuscript , and then <eol> wast ready to reveal the truth it bears <eol> why art thou silent ! why shouldst thou be dead <eol>
