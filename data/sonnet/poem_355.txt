death , what hast thou to do with one for whom <eol> time is not lord , but servant ? what least part <eol> of all the fire that fed his living heart <eol> of all the light more keen than sundawn 's bloom <eol> that lit and led his spirit , strong as doom <eol> and bright as hope , can aught thy breath may dart <eol> quench ? nay , thou knowest he knew thee what thou art <eol> a shadow born of terror 's barren womb <eol> that brings not forth save shadows . what art thou <eol> to dream , albeit thou breathe upon his brow <eol> that power on him is given thee ,â€” that thy breath <eol> can make him less than love acclaims him now <eol> and hears all time sound back the word it saith <eol> what part hast thou then in his glory , death <eol>
