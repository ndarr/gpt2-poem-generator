can it be right to give what i can give <eol> to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears <eol> as salt as mine , and hear the sighing years <eol> re sighing on my lips renunciative <eol> through those infrequent smiles which fail to live <eol> for all thy adjurations ? o my fears <eol> that this can scarce be right ! we are not peers <eol> so to be lovers ; and i own , and grieve <eol> that givers of such gifts as mine are , must <eol> be counted with the ungenerous . out , alas <eol> i will not soil thy purple with my dust <eol> nor breathe my poison on thy venice glass <eol> nor give thee any love â€” which were unjust <eol> beloved , i only love thee ! let it pass <eol>
