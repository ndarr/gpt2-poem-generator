the maple with its tassel flowers of green <eol> that turns to red a staghorn shaped seed <eol> just spreading out its scolloped leaves is seen <eol> of yellowish hue , yet beautifully green <eol> bark ribbed like corderoy in seamy screed <eol> that farther up the stem is smoother seen <eol> where the white hemlock with white umbel flowers <eol> up each spread stoven to the branches towers <eol> and moss around the stoven spreads , dark green <eol> and blotched leaved orchis , and the blue bell flowers <eol> thickly they grow and neath the leaves are seen <eol> i love to see them gemmed with morning hours <eol> i love the lone green places where they be <eol> and the sweet clothing of the maple tree <eol>
