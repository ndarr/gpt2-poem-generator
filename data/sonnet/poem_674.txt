and now it would content me to yield up <eol> those lofty hopes awhile , for present gifts <eol> of humbler industry . but , oh , dear friend <eol> the poet , gentle creature as he is <eol> hath , like the lover , his unruly times <eol> his fits when he is neither sick nor well <eol> though no distress be near him but his own <eol> unmanageable thoughts : his mind , best pleased <eol> while she as duteous as the mother dove <eol> sits brooding , lives not always to that end <eol> but like the innocent bird , hath goadings on <eol> that drive her as in trouble through the groves ; [ l <eol> with me is now such passion , to be blamed <eol> no otherwise than as it lasts too long <eol>
