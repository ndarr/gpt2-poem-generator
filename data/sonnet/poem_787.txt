happy is england ! i could be content <eol> to see no other verdure than its own <eol> to feel no other breezes than are blown <eol> through its tall woods with high romances blent <eol> yet do i sometimes feel a languishment <eol> for skies italian , and an inward groan <eol> to sit upon an alp as on a throne <eol> and half forget what world or worldling meant <eol> happy is england , sweet her artless daughters <eol> enough their simple loveliness for me <eol> enough their whitest arms in silence clinging <eol> yet do i often warmly burn to see <eol> beauties of deeper glance , and hear their singing <eol> and float with them about the summer waters <eol>
