thou who didst make and knowest whereof we are made <eol> oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness <eol> our wordless tearless dumbness of distress <eol> bear thou in mind the burden thou hast laid <eol> upon us , and our feebleness unstayed <eol> except thou stay us : for the long long race <eol> which stretches far and far before our face <eol> thou knowest ,â€” remember thou whereof we are made <eol> if making makes us thine , then thine we are <eol> and if redemption , we are twice thine own <eol> if once thou didst come down from heaven afar <eol> to seek us and to find us , how not save <eol> comfort us , save us , leave us not alone <eol> thou who didst die our death and fill our grave <eol>
