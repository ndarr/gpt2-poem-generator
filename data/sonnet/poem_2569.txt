mary ! i want a lyre with other strings <eol> such aid from heaven as some have feigned they drew <eol> an eloquence scarce given to mortals , new <eol> and undebased by praise of meaner things <eol> that , ere through age or woe i shed my wings <eol> i may record thy worth with honor due <eol> in verse as musical as thou art true <eol> and that immortalizes whom it sings <eol> but thou hast little need . there is a book <eol> by seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light <eol> on which the eyes of god not rarely look <eol> a chronicle of actions just and bright <eol> there all thy deeds , my faithful mary , shine <eol> and , since thou own'st that praise , i spare thee mine <eol>
