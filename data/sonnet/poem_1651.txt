where slanting banks are always with the sun <eol> the daisy is in blossom even now <eol> and where warm patches by the hedges run <eol> the cottager when coming home from plough <eol> brings home a cowslip root in flower to set <eol> thus ere the christmas goes the spring is met <eol> setting up little tents about the fields <eol> in sheltered spots .— primroses when they get <eol> behind the wood 's old roots , where ivy shields <eol> their crimpled , curdled leaves , will shine and hide <eol> cart ruts and horses ’ footings scarcely yield <eol> a slur for boys , just crizzled and that 's all <eol> frost shoots his needles by the small dyke side <eol> and snow in scarce a feather 's seen to fall <eol>
