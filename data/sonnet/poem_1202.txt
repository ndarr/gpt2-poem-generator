thou tyrannizing monarch that dost tire <eol> my love sick heart through those assaulting eyes <eol> that are the lamps which lighten my desire <eol> if nought but death thy fury may suffice <eol> not for my peace , but for thy pleasure be it <eol> that phillis , wrathful phillis that repines me <eol> all grace but death , may deign to come and see it <eol> and seeing grieve at that which she assigns me <eol> this only boon for all my mortal bane <eol> i crave and cry for at thy mercy seat <eol> that when her wrath a faithful heart hath slain <eol> and soul is fled , and body reft of heat <eol> she might perceive how much she might command <eol> that had my life and death within her hand <eol>
