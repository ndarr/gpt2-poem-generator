grief dies like joy ; the tears upon my cheek <eol> will disappear like dew . dear god ! i know <eol> thy kindly providence hath made it so <eol> and thank thee for the law . i am too weak <eol> to make a friend of sorrow , or to wear <eol> with that dark angel ever by my side <eol> ( though to thy heaven there be no better guide <eol> a front of manly calm . yet , for i hear <eol> how woe hath cleansed , how grief can deify <eol> so weak a thing it seems that grief should die <eol> and love and friendship with it , i could pray <eol> that if it might not gloom upon my brow <eol> nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now <eol> no grief of mine should ever pass away <eol>
