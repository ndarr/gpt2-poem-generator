well can i recall that eve at sligo <eol> and the vacant arches of the abbey <eol> framing the ethereal rose of sunset <eol> round about me silence and gray shadow <eol> peopled with the wraiths of time departed <eol> monks with back thrown cowls who pace the cloisters <eol> now deep mounded , crumbled , clad with ivy <eol> no more from the tower their chimes of silver <eol> will the bells fling o'er the town and river <eol> o'er the garavogue soft gliding seaward <eol> nevermore â€” save in deep dreams at midnight <eol> death , the immemorial lord of mortals <eol> he is abbot in the aisles of sligo <eol> till the spheres proclaim the resurrection <eol>
