come down , o christ , and help me ! reach thy hand <eol> for i am drowning in a stormier sea <eol> than simon on thy lake of galilee <eol> the wine of life is spilt upon the sand <eol> my heart is as some famine murdered land <eol> whence all good things have perished utterly <eol> and well i know my soul in hell must lie <eol> if i this night before god 's throne should stand <eol> â€˜ he sleeps perchance , or rideth to the chase <eol> like baal , when his prophets howled that name <eol> from morn to noon on carmel 's smitten height <eol> nay , peace , i shall behold , before the night <eol> the feet of brass , the robe more white than flame <eol> the wounded hands , the weary human face <eol>
