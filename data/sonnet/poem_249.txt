to live in hell , and heaven to behold <eol> to welcome life , and die a living death <eol> to sweat with heat , and yet be freezing cold <eol> to grasp at stars , and lie the earth beneath <eol> to treat a maze that never shall have end <eol> to burn in sighs , and starve in daily tears <eol> to climb a hill , and never to descend <eol> giants to kill , and quake at childish fears <eol> to pine for food , and watch th â€™ hesperian tree <eol> to thirst for drink , and nectar still to draw <eol> to live accurs 'd whom men hold blest to be <eol> and weep those wrongs which never creature saw <eol> if this be love , if love in these be founded <eol> my heart is love , for these in it are grounded <eol>
