when old jack died , it seemed to us , some way <eol> that all the other dogs in town were pained <eol> with our bereavement , and some that were chained <eol> even , unslipped their collars on that day <eol> to visit jack in state , as though to pay <eol> a last , sad tribute there , while neighbors craned <eol> their heads above the high board fence , and deigned <eol> to sigh “ poor dog ! ” remembering how they <eol> had cuffed him , when alive , perchance , because <eol> for love of them he leaped to lick their hands <eol> now , that he could not , were they satisfied <eol> we children thought that , as we crossed his paws <eol> and o'er his grave , ‘ way down the bottom lands <eol> wrote “ our first love lies here , ” when old jack died <eol>
