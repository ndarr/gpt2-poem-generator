if , aged charon , when my life shall end <eol> i pass thy ferry and my waftage pay <eol> thy oars shall fall , thy boat and mast shall rend <eol> and through the deep shall be a dry foot way <eol> for why ? my heart with sighs doth breathe such flame <eol> that air and water both incens Ã¨ d be <eol> the boundless ocean from whose mouth they came <eol> for from my heat not heaven itself is free <eol> then since to me thy loss can be no gain <eol> avoid thy harm and fly what i foretell <eol> make thou thy love with me for to be slain <eol> that i with her and both with thee may dwell <eol> thy fact thus , charon , both of us shall bless <eol> thou save thy boat and i my love possess <eol>
