by day she woos me , soft , exceeding fair <eol> but all night as the moon so changeth she <eol> loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy <eol> and subtle serpents gliding in her hair <eol> by day she woos me to the outer air <eol> ripe fruits , sweet flowers , and full satiety <eol> but through the night , a beast she grins at me <eol> a very monster void of love and prayer <eol> by day she stands a lie : by night she stands <eol> in all the naked horror of the truth <eol> with pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands <eol> is this a friend indeed ; that i should sell <eol> my soul to her , give her my life and youth <eol> till my feet , cloven too , take hold on hell <eol>
