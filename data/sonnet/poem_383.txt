see the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow <eol> which who but feels can taste , but thinks can know <eol> yet poor with fortune , and with learning blind <eol> the bad must miss ; the good , untaught , will find <eol> slave to no sect , who takes no private road <eol> but looks through nature up to nature 's god <eol> pursues that chain which links th â€™ immense design <eol> joins heaven and earth , and mortal and divine <eol> sees , that no being any bliss can know <eol> but touches some above , and some below <eol> learns , from this union of the rising whole <eol> the first , last purpose of the human soul <eol> and knows where faith , law , morals , all began <eol> all end , in love of god , and love of man <eol>
