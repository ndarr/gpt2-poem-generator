oh , my beloved , have you thought of this <eol> how in the years to come unscrupulous time <eol> more cruel than death , will tear you from my kiss <eol> and make you old , and leave me in my prime <eol> how you and i , who scale together yet <eol> a little while the sweet , immortal height <eol> no pilgrim may remember or forget <eol> as sure as the world turns , some granite night <eol> shall lie awake and know the gracious flame <eol> gone out forever on the mutual stone <eol> and call to mind that on the day you came <eol> i was a child , and you a hero grown <eol> and the night pass , and the strange morning break <eol> upon our anguish for each other 's sake <eol>
