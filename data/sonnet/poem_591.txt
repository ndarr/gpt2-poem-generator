god made my lady lovely to behold <eol> above the painter 's dream he set her face <eol> and wrought her body in divinest grace <eol> he touched the brown hair with a sense of gold <eol> and in the perfect form he did enfold <eol> what was alone as perfect , the sweet heart <eol> knowledge most rare to her he did impart <eol> and filled with love and worship all her days <eol> and then god thought him how it would be well <eol> to give her music , and to love he said <eol> â€œ bring thou some minstrel now that he may tell <eol> how fair and sweet a thing my hands have made <eol> then at love 's call i came , bowed down my head <eol> and at his will my lyre grew audible <eol>
