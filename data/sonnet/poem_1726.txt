my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still <eol> while comments of your praise richly compiled <eol> reserve their character with golden quill <eol> and precious phrase by all the muses filed <eol> i think good thoughts , whilst other write good words <eol> and like unlettered clerk still cry amen <eol> to every hymn that able spirit affords <eol> in polished form of well refined pen <eol> hearing you praised , i say ‘ tis so , ‘ tis true <eol> and to the most of praise add something more <eol> but that is in my thought , whose love to you <eol> ( though words come hindmost ) holds his rank before <eol> then others , for the breath of words respect <eol> me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect <eol>
