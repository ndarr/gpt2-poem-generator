beloved , thou hast brought me many flowers <eol> plucked in the garden , all the summer through <eol> and winter , and it seemed as if they grew <eol> in this close room , nor missed the sun and showers <eol> so , in the like name of that love of ours <eol> take back these thoughts which here unfolded too <eol> and which on warm and cold days i withdrew <eol> from my heart 's ground . indeed , those beds and bowers <eol> be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue <eol> and wait thy weeding ; yet here 's eglantine <eol> here 's ivy !â€” take them , as i used to do <eol> thy flowers , and keep them where they shall not pine <eol> instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true <eol> and tell thy soul , their roots are left in mine <eol>
