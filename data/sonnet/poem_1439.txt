can i forget the dismal night that gave <eol> my soul 's best part forever to the grave <eol> how silent did his old companions tread <eol> by midnight lamps , the mansions of the dead <eol> through breathing statues , then unheeded things <eol> through rows of warriors , and through walks of kings <eol> what awe did the slow solemn knell inspire <eol> the pealing organ , and the pausing choir <eol> the duties by the lawn robed prelate paid <eol> and the last words , that dust to dust conveyed <eol> while speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend <eol> accept these tears , thou dear departed friend <eol> oh , gone forever ! take this long adieu <eol> and sleep in peace next thy loved montague <eol>
