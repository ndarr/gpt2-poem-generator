then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now <eol> now while the world is bent my deeds to cross <eol> join with the spite of fortune , make me bow <eol> and do not drop in for an after loss <eol> ah do not , when my heart hath â€˜ scaped this sorrow <eol> come in the rearward of a conquered woe <eol> give not a windy night a rainy morrow <eol> to linger out a purposed overthrow <eol> if thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last <eol> when other petty griefs have done their spite <eol> but in the onset come , so shall i taste <eol> at first the very worst of fortune 's might <eol> and other strains of woe , which now seem woe <eol> compared with loss of thee , will not seem so <eol>
