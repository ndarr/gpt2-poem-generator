licia my love was sitting in a grove <eol> tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs <eol> but straight she spied where two together strove <eol> each one complaining of the other 's wrongs <eol> cupid did cry lamenting of the harm <eol> jove 's messenger , thou wrong'st me too too far <eol> use thou thy rod , rely upon the charm <eol> think not by speech my force thou canst debar <eol> a rod , sir boy , were fitter for a child <eol> my weapons oft and tongue and mind you took <eol> and in my wrong at my distress thou smiled <eol> and scorned to grace me with a loving look <eol> speak you , sweet love , for you did all the wrong <eol> that broke his arrows , and did bind his tongue <eol>
