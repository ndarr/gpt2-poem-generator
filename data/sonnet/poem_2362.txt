o thou ! whose steps in sacred reverence tread <eol> these lone dominions of the silent dead <eol> on this sad stone a pious look bestow <eol> nor uninstructed read this tale of woe <eol> and while the sigh of sorrow heaves thy breast <eol> let each rebellious murmur be suppress 'd <eol> heaven 's hidden ways to trace , for us how vain <eol> heaven 's wise decrees , how impious to arraign <eol> pure from the stains of a polluted age <eol> in early bloom of life they left the stage <eol> not doom 'd in lingering woe to waste their breath <eol> one moment snatch 'd them from the power of death <eol> they lived united , and united died <eol> happy the friends whom death cannot divide <eol>
