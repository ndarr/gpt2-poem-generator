brave little people , of large aims , you bow <eol> too often , and too low before the past <eol> you sit too long in worship of the dead <eol> yet have you risen , open eyed , to greet <eol> the great material present . now salute <eol> the greater future , blazing its bold trail <eol> through old traditions . leave your dead to sleep <eol> in quiet peace with god . let your concern <eol> be with the living , and the yet unborn <eol> bestow on them your thoughts , and waste no time <eol> in costly honours to insensate dust <eol> unlock the doors of usefulness , and lead <eol> your lovely daughters forth to larger fields <eol> away from jungles of the ancient sin <eol>
