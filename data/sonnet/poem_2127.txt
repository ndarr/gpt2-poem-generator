if ever sorrow spoke from soul that loves <eol> as speaks a spirit in a man possest <eol> in me her spirit speaks . my soul it moves <eol> whose sigh swoll'n words breed whirlwinds in my breast <eol> or like the echo of a passing bell <eol> which sounding on the water seems to howl <eol> so rings my heart a fearful heavy knell <eol> and keeps all night in consort with the owl <eol> my cheeks with a thin ice of tears are clad <eol> mine eyes like morning stars are bleared and red <eol> what resteth then but i be raging mad <eol> to see that she , my cares â€™ chief conduit head <eol> when all streams else help quench my burning heart <eol> shuts up her springs and will no grace impart <eol>
