meek twilight ! soften the declining day <eol> and bring the hour my pensive spirit loves <eol> when , o'er the mountain flow descends the ray <eol> that gives to silence the deserted groves <eol> ah , let the happy court the morning still <eol> when , in her blooming loveliness array 'd <eol> she bids fresh beauty light the vale , or hill <eol> and rapture warble in the vocal shade <eol> sweet is the odour of the morning 's flower <eol> and rich in melody her accents rise <eol> yet dearer to my soul the shadowy hour <eol> at which her blossoms close , her music dies <eol> for then , while languid nature droops her head <eol> she wakes the tear â€˜ tis luxury to shed <eol>
