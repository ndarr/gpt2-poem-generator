say over again , and yet once over again <eol> that thou dost love me . though the word repeated <eol> should seem a “ cuckoo song , ” as thou dost treat it <eol> remember , never to the hill or plain <eol> valley and wood , without her cuckoo strain <eol> comes the fresh spring in all her green completed <eol> beloved , i , amid the darkness greeted <eol> by a doubtful spirit voice , in that doubt 's pain <eol> cry , “ speak once more — thou lovest ! ” who can fear <eol> too many stars , though each in heaven shall roll <eol> too many flowers , though each shall crown the year <eol> say thou dost love me , love me , love me — toll <eol> the silver iterance !— only minding , dear <eol> to love me also in silence with thy soul <eol>
