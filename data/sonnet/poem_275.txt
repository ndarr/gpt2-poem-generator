thus live undying through the lapse of time <eol> the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime <eol> like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane <eol> they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain <eol> yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees <eol> saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze <eol> and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile <eol> and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile <eol> but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears <eol> its laurelled columns through the mist of years <eol> as the blue arches of the bending skies <eol> still gird the torrent , following as it flies <eol> spreads , with the surges bearing on mankind <eol> its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind <eol>
