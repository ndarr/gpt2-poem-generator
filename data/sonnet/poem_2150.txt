my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming <eol> i love not less , though less the show appear <eol> that love is merchandized , whose rich esteeming <eol> the owner 's tongue doth publish every where <eol> our love was new , and then but in the spring <eol> when i was wont to greet it with my lays <eol> as philomel in summer 's front doth sing <eol> and stops her pipe in growth of riper days <eol> not that the summer is less pleasant now <eol> than when her mournful hymns did hush the night <eol> but that wild music burthens every bough <eol> and sweets grown common lose their dear delight <eol> therefore like her , i sometime hold my tongue <eol> because i would not dull you with my song <eol>
