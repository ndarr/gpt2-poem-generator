if the dull substance of my flesh were thought <eol> injurious distance should not stop my way <eol> for then despite of space i would be brought <eol> from limits far remote , where thou dost stay <eol> no matter then although my foot did stand <eol> upon the farthest earth removed from thee <eol> for nimble thought can jump both sea and land <eol> as soon as think the place where he would be <eol> but ah , thought kills me that i am not thought <eol> to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone <eol> but that so much of earth and water wrought <eol> i must attend , time 's leisure with my moan <eol> receiving nought by elements so slow <eol> but heavy tears , badges of either 's woe <eol>
