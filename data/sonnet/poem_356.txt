a wall , a wall around my garden rear <eol> and hedge me in from the disconsolate hills <eol> give me but one of all the mountain rills <eol> enough of ocean in its voice i hear <eol> come no profane insatiate mortal near <eol> with the contagion of his passionate ills <eol> the smoke of battle all the valley fills <eol> let the eternal sunlight greet me here <eol> this spot is sacred to the deeper soul <eol> and to the piety that mocks no more <eol> in nature 's inmost heart is no uproar <eol> none in this shrine ; in peace the heavens roll <eol> in peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore <eol> and ancient quiet broods from pole to pole <eol>
