here from this summit where i often roam <eol> i can behold my cot , my humble home <eol> there i was born , and when this life is o'er <eol> i hope to sleep upon the river 's shore <eol> there is the orchard which i helped to rear <eol> it well repays my labor year by year <eol> one apple tree towers high above the rest <eol> where every spring a blackbird has its nest <eol> sweet lily used to stand beneath the bough <eol> and smiling listen â€” but she comes not now <eol> a fairer bird ne'er charmed the rising day <eol> than she we loved thus early called away <eol> but she is gone to sing her holy strains <eol> in lovelier gardens and on greener plains <eol>
