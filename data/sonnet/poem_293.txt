within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush <eol> that overhung a mole hill large and round <eol> i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush <eol> sing hymns of rapture , while i drank the sound <eol> with joy ; and oft , an unintruding guest <eol> i watch 'd her secret toils from day to day <eol> how true she warp 'd the moss to form her nest <eol> and modell 'd it within with wool and clay <eol> and bye and bye , like heath bells gilt with dew <eol> there lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers <eol> ink spotted over , shells of green and blue <eol> and there i witness 'd , in the summer hours <eol> a brood of nature 's minstrels chirp and fly <eol> glad as the sunshine and the laughing sky <eol>
