since shunning pain , i ease can never find <eol> since bashful dread seeks where he knows me harmed <eol> since will is won , and stopped ears are charmed <eol> since force doth faint , and sight doth make me blind <eol> since loosing long , the faster still i bind <eol> since naked sense can conquer reason armed <eol> since heart , in chilling fear , with ice is warmed <eol> in fine , since strife of thought but mars the mind <eol> i yield , o love , unto thy loathed yoke <eol> yet craving law of arms , whose rule doth teach <eol> that , hardly used , who ever prison broke <eol> in justice quit , of honour made no breach <eol> whereas , if i a grateful guardian have <eol> thou art my lord , and i thy vowed slave <eol>
