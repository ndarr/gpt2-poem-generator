the snow falls deep ; the forest lies alone <eol> the boy goes hasty for his load of brakes <eol> then thinks upon the fire and hurries back <eol> the gipsy knocks his hands and tucks them up <eol> and seeks his squalid camp , half hid in snow <eol> beneath the oak which breaks away the wind <eol> and bushes close in snow like hovel warm <eol> there tainted mutton wastes upon the coals <eol> and the half wasted dog squats close and rubs <eol> then feels the heat too strong , and goes aloof <eol> he watches well , but none a bit can spare <eol> and vainly waits the morsel thrown away <eol> tis thus they live â€” a picture to the place <eol> a quiet , pilfering , unprotected race <eol>
