shall the hag evil die with the child of good <eol> or propagate again her loath Ã¨ d kind <eol> thronging the cells of the diseased mind <eol> hateful with hanging cheeks , a withered brood <eol> though hourly pastured on the salient blood <eol> oh ! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat <eol> would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat <eol> of their broad vans , and in the solitude <eol> of middle space confound them , and blow back <eol> their wild cries down their cavernthroats , and slake <eol> with points of blastborne hail their heated eyne <eol> so their wan limbs no more might come between <eol> the moon and the moon 's reflex in the night <eol> nor blot with floating shades the solar light <eol>
