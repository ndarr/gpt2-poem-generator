o gracious mother , whose benignant breast <eol> wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest <eol> how thy sweet features , kind to every clime <eol> mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time <eol> we stain thy flowers ,â€” they blossom o'er the dead <eol> we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread <eol> o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn <eol> waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn <eol> our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain <eol> still thy soft answer is the growing grain <eol> yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms <eol> steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms <eol> let not our virtues in thy love decay <eol> and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away <eol>
