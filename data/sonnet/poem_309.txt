“ ‘ o friends , a thousand ways frail mortals lead <eol> to the cold tomb , and dreadful all to tread <eol> but dreadful most , when by a slow decay <eol> pale hunger wastes the manly strength away <eol> why cease ye then to implore the powers above <eol> and offer hecatombs to thundering jove <eol> why seize ye not yon beeves , and fleecy prey <eol> arise unanimous ; arise and slay <eol> and if the gods ordain a safe return <eol> to phoebus shrines shall rise , and altars burn <eol> but should the powers that o'er mankind preside <eol> decree to plunge us in the whelming tide <eol> better to rush at once to shades below <eol> than linger life away , and nourish woe <eol>
