immortal eloquence of mystic art <eol> how strangely o'er oblivion and gray time <eol> that hand doth speak , as in the painter 's prime <eol> it uttered thus his own and mary 's heart <eol> at sight of it , what rich conjectures start <eol> adown the years , what wistful aves chime <eol> that wake the soul to rapture how sublime <eol> wherewith we , too , must bear in him our part <eol> for unto each to bring redemption 's share <eol> whereby adown the ages christ is borne <eol> there comes the angel of the lilied rod <eol> and though our souls with anguish sore are torn <eol> we pray once more the world o'ercoming prayer <eol> and then is born in us the word of god <eol>
