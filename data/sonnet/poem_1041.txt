it is not then enough that men who give <eol> the best gifts given of man to man should feel <eol> alive , a snake 's head ever at their heel <eol> small hurt the worms may do them while they live <eol> such hurt as scorn for scorn 's sake may forgive <eol> but now , when death and fame have set one seal <eol> on tombs whereat love , grief , and glory kneel <eol> men sift all secrets , in their critic sieve <eol> of graves wherein the dust of death might shrink <eol> to know what tongues defile the dead man 's name <eol> with loathsome love , and praise that stings like shame <eol> rest once was theirs , who had crossed the mortal brink <eol> no rest , no reverence now : dull fools undress <eol> death 's holiest shrine , life 's veriest nakedness <eol>
