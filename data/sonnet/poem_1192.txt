i dreamed we walked together , you and i <eol> along a white and lonely road , that went <eol> i know not where . . . and we were well content <eol> our laughter was untroubled as the sky <eol> and all our talk was delicate and shy <eol> though in that cage of words wild thoughts were pent <eol> like prisoned birds that some sweet accident <eol> might yet release to sing again , and fly <eol> we passed between long lines of poplar trees <eol> where , summer comrades gay and debonair <eol> the south wind and the sunlight danced . . . you smiled <eol> with great glad eyes , as bright as summer seas <eol> to feel their twinkling fingers in your hair <eol> and then you kissed me , quickly , like a child <eol>
