dear chorister , who from those shadows sends <eol> ere that the blushing morn dare show her light <eol> such sad lamenting strains , that night attends <eol> become all ear , stars stay to hear thy plight <eol> if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends <eol> who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight <eol> may thee importune who like care pretends <eol> and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite <eol> tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try <eol> and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains <eol> since , winter gone , the sun in dappled sky <eol> now smiles on meadows , mountains , woods , and plains <eol> the bird , as if my questions did her move <eol> with trembling wings sobbed forth , i love ! i love <eol>
