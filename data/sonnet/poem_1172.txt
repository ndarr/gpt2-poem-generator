from upland slopes i see the cows file by <eol> lowing , great chested , down the homeward trail <eol> by dusking fields and meadows shining pale <eol> with moon tipped dandelions . flickering high <eol> a peevish night hawk in the western sky <eol> beats up into the lucent solitudes <eol> or drops with griding wing . the stilly woods <eol> grow dark and deep and gloom mysteriously <eol> cool night winds creep , and whisper in mine ear <eol> the homely cricket gossips at my feet <eol> from far off pools and wastes of reeds i hear <eol> clear and soft piped , the chanting frogs break sweet <eol> in full pandean chorus . one by one <eol> shine out the stars , and the great night comes on <eol>
