as to some lovely temple , tenantless <eol> long since , that once was sweet with shivering brass <eol> knowing well its altars ruined and the grass <eol> grown up between the stones , yet from excess <eol> of grief hard driven , or great loneliness <eol> the worshiper returns , and those who pass <eol> marvel him crying on a name that was <eol> so is it now with me in my distress <eol> your body was a temple to delight <eol> cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled <eol> yet here one time your spirit was wont to move <eol> here might i hope to find you day or night <eol> and here i come to look for you , my love <eol> even now , foolishly , knowing you are dead <eol>
