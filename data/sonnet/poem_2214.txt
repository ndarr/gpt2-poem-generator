i could not find the little maid content <eol> so out i rushed , and sought her far and wide <eol> but not where pleasure each new fancy tried <eol> heading the maze of rioting merriment <eol> nor where , with restless eyes and bow half bent <eol> love in the brake of sweetbriar smiled and sighed <eol> nor yet where fame towered , crowned and glorified <eol> found i her face , nor wheresoe'er i went <eol> so homeward back i crawled , like wounded bird <eol> when lo ! content sate spinning at my door <eol> and when i asked her where she was before <eol> “ here all the time , ” she said ; “ i never stirred <eol> too eager in thy search , you passed me o'er <eol> and , though i called you , neither saw nor heard <eol>
