because i oft in dark abstracted guise <eol> seem most alone in greatest company <eol> with dearth of words , or answers quite awry <eol> to them that would make speech of speech arise <eol> they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies <eol> that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie <eol> so in my swelling breast , that only i <eol> fawn on myself , and others do despise <eol> yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess <eol> which looks too oft in his unflattering glass <eol> but one worse fault , ambition , i confess <eol> that makes me oft my best friends overpass <eol> unseen , unheard , while thought to highest place <eol> bends all his powers , even unto stella 's grace <eol>
