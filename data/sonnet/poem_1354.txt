but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again <eol> now whilst thy may hath filled thy lap with flowers <eol> now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain <eol> now use thy summer smiles , ere winter lowers <eol> and whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun <eol> the fairest flower that ever saw the light <eol> now joy thy time before thy sweet be done <eol> and , delia , think thy morning must have night <eol> and that thy brightness sets at length to west <eol> when thou wilt close up that which now thou showest <eol> and think the same becomes thy fading best <eol> which then shall most inveil and shadow most <eol> men do not weigh the stalk for that it was <eol> when once they find her flower , her glory pass <eol>
