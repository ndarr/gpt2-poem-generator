beyond the north wind lay the land of old <eol> where men dwelt blithe and blameless , clothed and fed <eol> with joy 's bright raiment and with love 's sweet bread <eol> the whitest flock of earth 's maternal fold <eol> none there might wear about his brows enrolled <eol> a light of lovelier fame than rings your head <eol> whose lovesome love of children and the dead <eol> all men give thanks for : i far off behold <eol> a dear dead hand that links us , and a light <eol> the blithest and benignest of the night <eol> the night of death 's sweet sleep , wherein may be <eol> a star to show your spirit in present sight <eol> some happier island in the elysian sea <eol> where rab may lick the hand of marjorie <eol>
