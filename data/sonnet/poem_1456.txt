master of human destinies am i <eol> fame , love , and fortune on my footsteps wait <eol> cities and fields i walk ; i penetrate <eol> deserts and seas remote , and passing by <eol> hovel and mart and palace — soon or late <eol> i knock , unbidden , once at every gate <eol> if sleeping , wake — if feasting , rise before <eol> i turn away . it is the hour of fate <eol> and they who follow me reach every state <eol> mortals desire , and conquer every foe <eol> save death ; but those who doubt or hesitate <eol> condemned to failure , penury , and woe <eol> seek me in vain and uselessly implore <eol> i answer not , and i return no more <eol>
