thou whose spell can raise the dead <eol> bid the prophet 's form appear <eol> “ samuel , raise thy buried head <eol> king , behold the phantom seer <eol> earth yawned ; he stood the centre of a cloud <eol> light changed its hue , retiring from his shroud . [ lm <eol> death stood all glassy in his fix é d eye <eol> his hand was withered , and his veins were dry <eol> his foot , in bony whiteness , glittered there <eol> shrunken and sinewless , and ghastly bare <eol> from lips that moved not and unbreathing frame <eol> like caverned winds , the hollow accents came <eol> saul saw , and fell to earth , as falls the oak <eol> at once , and blasted by the thunder stroke .
