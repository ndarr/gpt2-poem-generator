i like the man who faces what he must <eol> with step triumphant and a heart of cheer <eol> who fights the daily battle without fear <eol> sees his hopes fail , yet keeps unfaltering trust <eol> that god is god ; that somehow , true and just <eol> his plans work out for mortals ; not a tear <eol> is shed when fortune , which the world holds dear <eol> falls from his grasp : better , with love , a crust <eol> than living in dishonor : envies not <eol> nor loses faith in man ; but does his best <eol> nor ever murmurs at his humbler lot <eol> but , with a smile and words of hope , gives zest <eol> to every toiler : he alone is great <eol> who by a life heroic conquers fate <eol>
