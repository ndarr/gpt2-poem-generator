i writ how once i wander 'd from thy side <eol> serving the strong suggestions of my blood <eol> only to prove from worse things vainly tried <eol> how far more precious grew thy sum of good <eol> if i so lov 'd thee , what is my defence <eol> that thy dear love fail 'd then my steps to stay <eol> that idle hours were idly given to sense <eol> and soul forsaken at the call of clay <eol> o let love grant excuse ; my sensual part <eol> dwelt ever far from pure untainted thee <eol> it held no conversation with my heart <eol> nor , us 'd or check 'd , could be thine injury <eol> if once it triumph 'd , carrying me away <eol> it stole but earth ; my soul did with thee stay <eol>
