which are the clouds , and which the mountains ? see <eol> they mix and melt together ! yon blue hill <eol> looks fleeting as the vapors which distill <eol> their dews upon its summit , while the free <eol> and far off clouds , now solid , dark , and still <eol> an aspect wear of calm eternity <eol> each seems the other , as our fancies will <eol> the cloud a mount , the mount a cloud , and we <eol> gaze doubtfully . so everywhere on earth <eol> this foothold where we stand with slipping feet <eol> the unsubstantial and substantial meet <eol> and we are fooled until made wise by time <eol> is not the obvious lesson something worth <eol> lady ? or have i wov'n an idle rhyme <eol>
