“ ‘ i died for thee ; for thee i am alive <eol> and my humanity doth mourn for thee <eol> for thou art mine ; and all thy little ones <eol> they , too , are mine , are mine . behold , the house <eol> is dark , but there is brightness where the sons <eol> of god are singing , and , behold , the heart <eol> is troubled : yet the nations walk in white <eol> they have forgotten how to weep ; and thou <eol> shalt also come , and i will foster thee <eol> and satisfy thy soul ; and thou shall warm <eol> thy trembling life beneath the smile of god <eol> a little while — it is a little while <eol> a little while , and i will comfort thee <eol> i go away , but i will come again <eol>
