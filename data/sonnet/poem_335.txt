o lords our gods , it is not that ye sit <eol> serene above the thunder , and exempt <eol> from strife of tongues and casualties that tempt <eol> men merely found by proof of manhood fit <eol> for service of their fellows : this is it <eol> which sets you past the reach of time 's attempt <eol> which gives us right of justified contempt <eol> for commonwealths built up by mere men 's wit <eol> that gold unlocks not , nor may flatteries ope <eol> the portals of your heaven ; that none may hope <eol> with you to watch how life beneath you plods <eol> save for high service given , high duty done <eol> that never was your rank ignobly won <eol> for this we give you praise , o lords our gods <eol>
