i am afraid , oh i am so afraid <eol> the cold black fear is clutching me to night <eol> as long ago when they would take the light <eol> and leave the little child who would have prayed <eol> frozen and sleepless at the thought of death <eol> my heart that beats too fast will rest too soon <eol> i shall not know if it be night or noon <eol> yet shall i struggle in the dark for breath <eol> will no one fight the terror for my sake <eol> the heavy darkness that no dawn will break <eol> how can they leave me in that dark alone <eol> who loved the joy of light and warmth so much <eol> and thrilled so with the sense of sound and touch <eol> how can they shut me underneath a stone <eol>
