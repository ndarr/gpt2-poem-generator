small , busy flames play through the fresh laid coals <eol> and their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep <eol> like whispers of the household gods that keep <eol> a gentle empire o'er fraternal souls <eol> and while , for rhymes , i search around the poles <eol> your eyes are fix 'd , as in poetic sleep <eol> upon the lore so voluble and deep <eol> that aye at fall of night our care condoles <eol> this is your birth day tom , and i rejoice <eol> that thus it passes smoothly , quietly <eol> many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise <eol> may we together pass , and calmly try <eol> what are this world 's true joys ,â€” ere the great voice <eol> from its fair face , shall bid our spirits fly <eol>
