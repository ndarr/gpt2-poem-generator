with all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate <eol> high souls that hate us ; for our hopes are higher <eol> and higher than yours the goal of our desire <eol> though high your ends be as your hearts are great <eol> your world of gods and kings , of shrine and state <eol> was of the night when hope and fear stood nigher <eol> wherein men walked by light of stars and fire <eol> till man by day stood equal with his fate <eol> honour not hate we give you , love not fear <eol> last prophets of past kind , who fill the dome <eol> of great dead gods with wrath and wail , nor hear <eol> time 's word and man 's : â€œ go honoured hence , go home <eol> night 's childless children ; here your hour is done <eol> pass with the stars , and leave us with the sun <eol>
