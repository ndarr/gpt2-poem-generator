live blindly and upon the hour . the lord <eol> who was the future , died full long ago <eol> knowledge which is the past is folly . go <eol> poor child , and be not to thyself abhorred <eol> around thine earth sun winged winds do blow <eol> and planets roll ; a meteor draws his sword <eol> the rainbow breaks his seven coloured chord <eol> and the long strips of river silver flow <eol> awake ! give thyself to the lovely hours <eol> drinking their lips , catch thou the dream in flight <eol> about their fragile hairs ’ aerial gold <eol> thou art divine , thou livest , — as of old <eol> apollo springing naked to the light <eol> and all his island shivered into flowers <eol>
