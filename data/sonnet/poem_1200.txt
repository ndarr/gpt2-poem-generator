o friend ! may each domestic bliss be thine <eol> be no unpleasing melancholy mine <eol> me , let the tender office long engage <eol> to rock the cradle of reposing age <eol> with lenient arts extend a mother 's breath <eol> make languor smile , and smooth the bed of death <eol> explore the thought , explain the asking eye <eol> and keep a while one parent from the sky <eol> on cares like these if length of days attend <eol> may heav'n , to bless those days , preserve my friend <eol> preserve him social , cheerful , and serene <eol> and just as rich as when he serv 'd a queen <eol> a . whether that blessing be deny 'd or giv'n <eol> thus far was right , the rest belongs to heav'n <eol>
