thou splendid girl that seemest the mother of all <eol> dear ceres aphrodite , with every lure <eol> that draws the bee to honey , with the call <eol> of moth winged night to sinners , yet as pure <eol> as the white nun that counts the stars for beads <eol> thou blest madonna of all broken needs <eol> thou melusine , thou sister of sorrowing man <eol> thou wave like laughter , thou dear sob in the throat <eol> thou all enfolding mercy , and thou song <eol> that gathers up each wild and wandering note <eol> and takes and breaks and heals and breaks the heart <eol> with the omnipotent tenderness of art <eol> and thou intelligence of rose leaves made <eol> that makes that little thing the brain afraid <eol>
