why are we by all creatures waited on <eol> why do the prodigal elements supply <eol> life and food to me , being more pure than i <eol> simpler , and further from corruption <eol> why brook'st thou , ignorant horse , subjection <eol> why do you , bull and boar , so sillily <eol> dissemble weakness , and by one man 's stroke die <eol> whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon <eol> weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you <eol> you have not sinned , nor need be timorous <eol> but wonder at a greater , for to us <eol> created nature doth these things subdue <eol> but their creator , whom sin nor nature tied <eol> for us , his creatures and his foes , hath died <eol>
