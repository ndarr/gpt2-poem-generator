o never say that i was false of heart <eol> though absence seemed my flame to qualify <eol> as easy might i from my self depart <eol> as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie <eol> that is my home of love , if i have ranged <eol> like him that travels i return again <eol> just to the time , not with the time exchanged <eol> so that my self bring water for my stain <eol> never believe though in my nature reigned <eol> all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood <eol> that it could so preposterously be stained <eol> to leave for nothing all thy sum of good <eol> for nothing this wide universe i call <eol> save thou my rose , in it thou art my all <eol>
