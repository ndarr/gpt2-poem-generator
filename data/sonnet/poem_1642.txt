such age , how beautiful ! o lady bright <eol> whose mortal lineaments seem all refined <eol> by favouring nature and a saintly mind <eol> to something purer and more exquisite <eol> than flesh and blood ; whene'er thou meet'est my sight <eol> when i behold thy blanched unwithered cheek <eol> thy temples fringed with locks of gleaming white <eol> and head that droops because the soul is meek <eol> thee with the welcome snowdrop i compare <eol> that child of winter , prompting thoughts that climb <eol> from desolation toward the genial prime <eol> or with the moon conquering earth 's misty air <eol> and filling more and more with crystal light <eol> as pensive evening deepens into night <eol>
