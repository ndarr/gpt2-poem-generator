father of nations ! help of the feeble hand <eol> strength of the strong ! to whom the nations kneel <eol> stay and destroyer , at whose just command <eol> earth 's kingdoms tremble and her empires reel <eol> who dost the low uplift , the small make great <eol> and dost abase the ignorantly proud <eol> of our scant people mould a mighty state <eol> to the strong , stern ,â€” to thee in meekness bowed <eol> father of unity , make this people one <eol> weld , interfuse them in the patriot 's flame <eol> whose forging on thine anvil was begun <eol> in blood late shed to purge the common shame <eol> that so our hearts , the fever of faction done <eol> banish old feud in our young nation 's name <eol>
