love hath i followed all too long , nought gaining <eol> and sighed i have in vain to sweet what smarteth <eol> but from his brow a fiery arrow parteth <eol> thinking that i should him resist not plaining <eol> but cowardly my heart submiss remaining <eol> yields to receive what shaft thy fair eye darteth <eol> well do i see thine eye my bale imparteth <eol> and that save death no hope i am detaining <eol> for what is he can alter fortune 's sliding <eol> one in his bed consumes his life away <eol> other in wars , another in the sea <eol> the like effects in me have their abiding <eol> for heavens avowed my fortune should be such <eol> that i should die by loving far too much <eol>
