eventful volume ! whatsoe'er the change <eol> of scene and clime — the adventures bold and strange <eol> the griefs — the frailties but too frankly told <eol> the loves , the feuds thy pages may unfold <eol> if truth with half so prompt a hand unlocks <eol> his virtues as his failings , we shall find <eol> the record there of friendships held like rocks <eol> and enmities like sun touched snow resigned <eol> of fealty , cherisht without change or chill <eol> in those who served him , young , and serve him still <eol> of generous aid given , with that noiseless art <eol> which wakes not pride , to many a wounded heart <eol> of acts — but , no — not from himself must aught <eol> of the bright features of his life be sought <eol>
