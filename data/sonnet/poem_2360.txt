to love and to remember ; that is good <eol> to love and to forget ; that is not well <eol> to lapse from love to hatred ; that is hell <eol> and death and torment , rightly understood <eol> soul dazed by love and sorrow , cheer thy mood <eol> more blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell <eol> ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell <eol> and salt with hope thy life 's insipid food <eol> love is the goal , love is the way we wend <eol> love is our parallel unending line <eol> whose only perfect parallel is christ <eol> beginning not begun , end without end <eol> for he who hath the heart of god sufficed <eol> can satisfy all hearts ,â€” yea , thine and mine <eol>
