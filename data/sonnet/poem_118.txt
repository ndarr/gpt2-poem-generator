but i have looked on pictures made by man <eol> wherein , at first , appeared but chaos wild <eol> so high the art transcended , it beguiled <eol> the eye as formless , and without a plan <eol> until the spirit , brooding o'er , began <eol> to see a purpose rise , like mountains piled <eol> when god said : let the dry earth , undefiled <eol> rise from the waves : it rose in twilight wan <eol> and so i fear thy pictures were too strange <eol> for us to pierce beyond their outmost look <eol> a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book <eol> an atmosphere too high for wings to range <eol> at god 's designs our spirits pale and change <eol> trembling as at a void , thought cannot brook <eol>
