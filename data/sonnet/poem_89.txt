now friends conversing my soft hours refine <eol> and tully 's tusculum revives in mine <eol> now to grave books i bid the mind retreat <eol> and such as make me rather good than great <eol> or o'er the works of easy fancy rove <eol> where flutes and innocence amuse the grove <eol> the native bard that on sicilian plains <eol> first sung the lowly manners of the swains <eol> or maro 's muse , that in the fairest light <eol> paints rural prospects and the charms of sight <eol> these soft amusements bring content along <eol> and fancy , void of sorrow , turns to song <eol> here beauteous health for all the year remain <eol> when the next comes , i 'll charm thee thus again <eol>
