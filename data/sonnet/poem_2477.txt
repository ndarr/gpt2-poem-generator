the darkness in the loft is sweet and warm <eol> with the stored hay ... darkness intensified <eol> by one bright shaft that enters through the wide <eol> tall doors from under fringes of a storm <eol> which makes the doomed sun brighter . on the hay <eol> perched mountain high they sit , and silently <eol> watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky <eol> and mark how heartbreakingly far away <eol> and yet how close and clear the distance seems <eol> while all at hand is cloud â€” brightness of dreams <eol> unrealisable , yet seen so clear <eol> so only just beyond the dark . they wait <eol> scarce knowing what they wait for , half in fear <eol> expectance draws the curtain from their fate <eol>
