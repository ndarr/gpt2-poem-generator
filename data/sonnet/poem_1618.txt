lord ! when you have enough , what need you care <eol> how merrily soever others fare <eol> though all the day i give and take delight <eol> doubt not , sufficient will be left at night <eol> â€˜ tis but a just and rational desire <eol> to light a taper at a neighbour 's fire <eol> there 's danger too , you think , in rich array <eol> and none can long be modest that are gay <eol> the cat , if you but singe her tabby skin <eol> the chimney keeps , and sits content within <eol> but once grown sleek , will from her corner run <eol> sport with her tail , and wanton in the sun <eol> she licks her fair round face , and frisks abroad <eol> to show her fur , and to be catterwaw 'd <eol>
