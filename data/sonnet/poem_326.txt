look , how the flower which ling'ringly doth fade <eol> the morning 's darling late , the summer 's queen <eol> spoil 'd of that juice which kept it fresh and green <eol> as high as it did raise , bows low the head <eol> right so the pleasures of my life being dead <eol> or in their contraries but only seen <eol> with swifter speed declines than erst it spread <eol> and , blasted , scarce now shows what it hath been <eol> as doth the pilgrim , therefore , whom the night <eol> by darkness would imprison on his way <eol> think on thy home , my soul , and think aright <eol> of what 's yet left thee of life 's wasting day <eol> thy sun posts westward , passed is thy morn <eol> and twice it is not given thee to be born <eol>
