so i once thought ! oh , once my very soul <eol> was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role <eol> life seemed so wonderful ; it held for me <eol> no purpose , no ambition , but to be <eol> loving and loved . my highest thought of fame <eol> was some day bearing my dear lover 's name <eol> alone , i ofttimes uttered it aloud <eol> or wrote it down , half timid , and all proud <eol> to see myself lost utterly in him <eol> as some small star might joy in growing dim <eol> when sinking in the sun ; or as the dew <eol> forgetting the brief little life it knew <eol> in space , might on the ocean 's bosom fall <eol> and ask for nothing â€” only to give all <eol>
