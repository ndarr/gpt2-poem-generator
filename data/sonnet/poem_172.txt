an ill march noon ; the flagstones gray with dust <eol> an all round east wind volleying straws and grit <eol> st. martin 's steps , where every venomous gust <eol> lingers to buffet , or sneap , the passing cit <eol> and in the gutter , squelching a rotten boot <eol> draped in a wrap that , modish ten year syne <eol> partners , obscene with sweat and grease and soot <eol> a horrible hat , that once was just as fine <eol> the drunkard 's mouth a wash for something drinkable <eol> the drunkard 's eye alert for casual toppers <eol> the drunkard 's neck stooped to a lot scarce thinkable <eol> a living , crawling blazoning of hot coppers <eol> he trails his mildews towards a kingdom come <eol> compact of sausage and mash and two o â€™ rum <eol>
