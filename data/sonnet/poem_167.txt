a modern hour from london ( as we spin <eol> into a silver thread the miles of space <eol> between us and our goal ) , there is a place <eol> apart from city traffic , dust , and din <eol> green with great trees , where hides a quiet inn <eol> here nelson last looked on the lovely face <eol> which made his world ; and by its magic grace <eol> trailed rosy clouds across each early sin <eol> and , leaning lawnward , is the room where keats <eol> wrote the last one of those immortal songs <eol> ( called by the critics of his day â€˜ mere rhymes <eol> a lark , high in the boxwood bough repeats <eol> those lyric strains , to idle passing throngs <eol> there by the little tavern of last times <eol>
