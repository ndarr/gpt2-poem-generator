this mighty empire hath but feet of clay <eol> of all its ancient chivalry and might <eol> our little island is forsaken quite <eol> some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay <eol> and from its hills that voice hath passed away <eol> which spake of freedom : o come out of it <eol> come out of it , my soul , thou art not fit <eol> for this vile traffic house , where day by day <eol> wisdom and reverence are sold at mart <eol> and the rude people rage with ignorant cries <eol> against an heritage of centuries <eol> it mars my calm : wherefore in dreams of art <eol> and loftiest culture i would stand apart <eol> neither for god , nor for his enemies <eol>
