how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame <eol> which like a canker in the fragrant rose <eol> doth spot the beauty of thy budding name <eol> o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose <eol> that tongue that tells the story of thy days <eol> ( making lascivious comments on thy sport <eol> cannot dispraise , but in a kind of praise <eol> naming thy name , blesses an ill report <eol> o what a mansion have those vices got <eol> which for their habitation chose out thee <eol> where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot <eol> and all things turns to fair , that eyes can see <eol> take heed ( dear heart ) of this large privilege <eol> the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge <eol>
