what right to freedom when we are not free <eol> when all the passions goad us into lust <eol> when , for the worthless spoil we lick the dust <eol> and while one half our people die , that we <eol> may sit with peace and freedom ‘ neath our tree <eol> the other gloats for plunder and for spoil <eol> bustles through daylight , vexes night with toil <eol> cheats , swindles , lies and steals !— shall such things be <eol> endowed with such grand boons as liberty <eol> brings in her train of blessings ? should we pray <eol> that such as these should still maintain the sway <eol> these soulless , senseless , heartless enemies <eol> of all that 's good and great , of all that 's wise <eol> worthy on earth , or in the eternal eyes <eol>
