the marvel of the ne'er familiar day <eol> sacred investiture of life renewed <eol> the chrism of dew , the coronal of flame <eol> low in the valley lies the conquered rout <eol> of man 's poor , trivial turmoil , lost and drowned <eol> under the mist , in gleaming rivers rolled <eol> where oozy marsh contends with frothing main <eol> and rounding all , springs one full , ambient arch <eol> one great good limpid world â€” so still , so still <eol> for no sound echoes from its crystal curve <eol> save four clear notes , the song of that lone bird <eol> who , brave but trembling , tries his morning hymn <eol> and has no heart to finish , for the awe <eol> and wonder of this pearling globe of dawn <eol>
