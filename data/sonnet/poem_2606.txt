the shivering wind sits in the oaks , whose limbs <eol> twisted and tortured , nevermore are still <eol> grief and decay sit with it ; they , whose chill <eol> autumnal touch makes hectic red the rims <eol> of all the oak leaves ; desolating , dims <eol> the ageratum 's blue that banks the rill <eol> and splits the milkweed 's pod upon the hill <eol> and shakes it free of the last seed that swims <eol> down goes the day despondent to its close <eol> and now the sunset 's hands of copper build <eol> a tower of brass , behind whose burning bars <eol> the day , in fierce , barbarian repose <eol> like some imprisoned inca sits , hate filled <eol> crowned with the gold corymbus of the stars <eol>
