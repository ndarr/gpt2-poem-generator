how should i sing when buffeting salt waves <eol> and stung with bitter surges , in whose might <eol> i toss , a cockleshell ? the dreadful night <eol> marshals its undefeated dark and raves <eol> in brutal madness , reeling over graves <eol> of vanquished men , long sunken out of sight <eol> sent wailing down to glut the ghoulish sprite <eol> who haunts foul seaweed forests and their caves <eol> no parting cloud reveals a watery star <eol> my cries are washed away upon the wind <eol> my cramped and blistering hands can find no spar <eol> my eyes with hope o'erstrained , are growing blind <eol> but painted on the sky great visions burn <eol> my voice , oblation from a shattered urn <eol>
