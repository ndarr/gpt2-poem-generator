my love , i have no fear that thou shouldst die <eol> albeit i ask no fairer life than this <eol> whose numbering clock is still thy gentle kiss <eol> while time and peace with hands enlock Ã¨ d fly <eol> yet care i not where in eternity <eol> we live and love , well knowing that there is <eol> no backward step for those who feel the bliss <eol> of faith as their most lofty yearnings high <eol> love hath so purified my being 's core <eol> meseems i scarcely should be startled even <eol> to find , some morn , that thou hadst gone before <eol> since , with thy love , this knowledge too was given <eol> which each calm day doth strengthen more and more <eol> that they who love are but one step from heaven <eol>
