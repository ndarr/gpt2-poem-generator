though night approaching bids for rest prepare <eol> still the flail echoes through the frosty air <eol> nor stops till deepest shades of darkness come <eol> sending at length the weary laborer home <eol> from him , with bed and nightly food supplied <eol> throughout the yard , hous 'd round on every side <eol> deep plunging cows their rustling feast enjoy <eol> and snatch sweet mouthfuls from the passing boy <eol> who moves unseen beneath his trailing load <eol> fills the tall racks , and leaves a scatter 'd road <eol> where oft the swine from ambush warm and dry <eol> bolt out , and scamper headlong to their sty <eol> when giles with well known voice , already there <eol> deigns them a portion of his evening care <eol>
