o wholesome death , thy sombre funeral car <eol> looms ever dimly on the lengthening way <eol> of life ; while , lengthening still , in sad array <eol> my deeds in long procession go , that are <eol> as mourners of the man they helped to mar <eol> i see it all in dreams , such as waylay <eol> the wandering fancy when the solid day <eol> has fallen in smoldering ruins , and night 's star <eol> aloft there , with its steady point of light <eol> mastering the eye , has wrapped the brain in sleep <eol> ah , when i die , and planets hold their flight <eol> above my grave , still let my spirit keep <eol> sometimes its vigil of divine remorse <eol> â€˜ midst pity , praise , or blame heaped o'er my corse <eol>
