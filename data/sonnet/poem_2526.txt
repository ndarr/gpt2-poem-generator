i know not why â€” but time , methinks , hath past <eol> more fleet than usual since we parted last <eol> it seems but like a dream of yesternight <eol> whose charm still hangs , with fond , delaying light <eol> and , ere the memory lose one glowing hue <eol> of former joy , we come to kindle new <eol> thus ever may the flying moments haste <eol> with trackless foot along life 's vulgar waste <eol> but deeply print and lingeringly move <eol> when thus they reach the sunny spots we love <eol> oh yes , whatever be our gay career <eol> let this be still the solstice of the year <eol> where pleasure 's sun shall at its height remain <eol> and slowly sink to level life again <eol>
