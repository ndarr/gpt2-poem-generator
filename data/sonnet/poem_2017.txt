lawrence , what though the world be growing dark <eol> and twilight cool thy potent day inclose <eol> the sun , beneath the round earth sunk , still glows <eol> all the night through , sleepless and young and stark <eol> oh , be thy spirit faithful as the lark <eol> more daring : in the midnight of thy woes <eol> dart through them , higher than earth 's shadow goes <eol> into the light of which thou art a spark <eol> be willing to be blind â€” that , in thy night <eol> the lord may bring his father to thy door <eol> and enter in , and feast thy soul with light <eol> then shall thou dream of darksome ways no more <eol> forget the gloom that round thy windows lies <eol> and shine , god 's house , all radiant in our eyes <eol>
