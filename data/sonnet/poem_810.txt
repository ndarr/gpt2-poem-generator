mysterious night ! spread wide thy silvery plume <eol> soft as swan 's down , brood o'er the sapphirine <eol> breadth of still shadowy waters dark as wine <eol> smooth out the liquid heavens that stars illume <eol> come with fresh airs breathing the faint perfume <eol> of deep walled gardens , groves of whispering pine <eol> scatter soft dews , waft pure sea scent of brine <eol> in sweet repose man 's pain , man 's love resume <eol> deep bosomed night ! not here where down the marge <eol> marble with palaces those lamps of earth <eol> tremble on trembling blackness ; nay , far hence <eol> there on the lake where space is lone and large <eol> and man 's life lost in broad indifference <eol> lilt thou the soul to spheres that gave her birth <eol>
