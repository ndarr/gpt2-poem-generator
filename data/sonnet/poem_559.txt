trained in the holy art whose lifted shield <eol> wards off the darts a never slumbering foe <eol> by hearth and wayside lurking , waits to throw <eol> oppression taught his helpful arm to wield <eol> the slayer 's weapon : on the murderous field <eol> the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low <eol> seeking its noblest victim . even so <eol> the charter of a nation must be sealed <eol> the healer 's brow the hero 's honors crowned <eol> from lowliest duty called to loftiest deed <eol> living , the oak leaf wreath his temples bound <eol> dying , the conqueror 's laurel was his meed <eol> last on the broken ramparts â€™ turf to bleed <eol> where freedom 's victory in defeat was found <eol>
