lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind <eol> sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind <eol> his soul , proud science never taught to stray <eol> far as the solar walk , or milky way <eol> yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n <eol> behind the cloud topt hill , an humbler heav'n <eol> some safer world in depth of woods embrac 'd <eol> some happier island in the watry waste <eol> where slaves once more their native land behold <eol> no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold <eol> to be , contents his natural desire <eol> he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire <eol> but thinks , admitted to that equal sky <eol> his faithful dog shall bear him company <eol>
