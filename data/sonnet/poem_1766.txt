still on this scene of grandeur , plenty , peace <eol> and ever varying beauty , he would gaze <eol> with sadness . he had heard these prophecies <eol> and felt the unrest in that great world within <eol> hid from our blinded eyes , yet ever near <eol> the very soul and life of this dead world <eol> which seers and prophets open eyed have seen <eol> on which the dying often raptured gaze <eol> and where they live when they are mourned as dead <eol> this world was now astir , foretelling day <eol> â€œ a king shall come , they say , to rule the world <eol> if he will rule ; but whence this mighty king <eol> my years decline apace , and yet no son <eol> of mine to rule or light my funeral pile <eol>
