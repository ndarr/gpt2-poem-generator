yet all its varied charms , forever free <eol> from task and tribute , labor yields to thee <eol> no more , when april sheds her fitful rain <eol> the sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain <eol> no more , when autumn strews the flaming leaves <eol> the reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves <eol> for thee alike the circling seasons flow <eol> till the first blossoms heave the latest snow <eol> in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts <eol> in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts <eol> in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds <eol> life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds <eol> its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep <eol> till what thou sowest mightier angels reap <eol>
