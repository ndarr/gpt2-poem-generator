how oft when thou , my music , music play'st <eol> upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds <eol> with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st <eol> the wiry concord that mine ear confounds <eol> do i envy those jacks that nimble leap <eol> to kiss the tender inward of thy hand <eol> whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap <eol> at the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand <eol> to be so tickled they would change their state <eol> and situation with those dancing chips <eol> o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait <eol> making dead wood more blest than living lips <eol> since saucy jacks so happy are in this <eol> give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss <eol>
