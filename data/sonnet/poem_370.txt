god who can bind the stars eternally <eol> with but a breath of spirit speech , a thought <eol> who can within earth 's arms lay the mad sea <eol> unseverably , and count it as sheer naught <eol> with his all might could bind not you and me <eol> for tho he pressed us heart to burning heart <eol> and set then to the passion that enthralls <eol> his sanction , still our souls stood e'er apart <eol> as aliens beating fierce against the walls <eol> of dark unsympathy that would upstart <eol> stood aliens , aye ! and would tho we should meet <eol> beyond the oblivion of unnumbered births <eol> upon some world where time cannot repeat <eol> the feeblest syllable that once was earth 's <eol>
