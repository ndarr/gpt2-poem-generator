false hope prolongs my ever certain grief <eol> traitor to me , and faithful to my love <eol> a thousand times it promised me relief <eol> yet never any true effect i prove <eol> oft when i find in her no truth at all <eol> i banish her , and blame her treachery <eol> yet soon again i must her back recall <eol> as one that dies without her company <eol> thus often , as i chase my hope from me <eol> straightway she hastes her unto delia 's eyes <eol> fed with some pleasing look , there shall she be <eol> and so sent back . and thus my fortune lies <eol> looks feed my hope , hope fosters me in vain <eol> hopes are unsure when certain is my pain <eol>
