look you , it is to day as at the first <eol> when adam first was ‘ ware his new made eyes <eol> and opened them , behold the light ! and breath <eol> of god was misting yet about his mouth <eol> whereof they had made his soul . then he looked forth <eol> and was a part of light ; also he saw <eol> beautiful life , and it could move . but eve — eve <eol> was the child of midnight and of sleep <eol> lo , in the dark god led her to his side <eol> it may be in the dark she heard him breathe <eol> before god woke him . and she knew not light <eol> nor life but as a voice that left his lips <eol> a warmth that clasped her ; but the stars were out <eol> and she with wide child eyes gazed up at them <eol>
