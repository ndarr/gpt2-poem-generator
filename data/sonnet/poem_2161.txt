o goodness in horror ! o ill not all ill <eol> in the worst of the worst may be fierce hope still <eol> to morrow with dawn will come many a wain <eol> and bear away loads of human pain <eol> piles of pale beds for the â€˜ spitals ; but some <eol> again will awake in home mornings , and some <eol> dull herds of the war , again follow the drum <eol> from others , faint blood shall in families flow <eol> with wonder at life , and young oldness in woe <eol> yet hence may the movers of great earth grow <eol> now , even now , i hear them at hand <eol> though again captain sword is up in the land <eol> marching anew for more fields like these <eol> in the health of his flag in the morning breeze <eol>
