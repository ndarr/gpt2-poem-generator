i think that look of christ might seem to say <eol> “ thou , peter ! art thou then a common stone <eol> which i at last must break my heart upon <eol> for all god 's charge to his high angels may <eol> guard my foot better ? did i yesterday <eol> wash thy feet , my beloved , that they should run <eol> quick to deny me , ‘ neath the morning sun <eol> and do thy kisses , like the rest , betray <eol> the cock crows coldly . go and manifest <eol> a late contrition , but no bootless fear <eol> for when thy deadly need is bitterest <eol> thou shall not be denied as i am here <eol> my voice , to god and angels , shall attest <eol> because i knew this man let him be clear <eol>
