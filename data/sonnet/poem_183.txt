but soon the morn , on many a distant height <eol> fingers the raven locks of lingering night <eol> the last dark shadows that precede the day <eol> have stripped the splendour from the milky way <eol> and nature seems disturbed by fitful dreams <eol> as one who shudders when the owlet screams <eol> the painful burden of the whippoorwill <eol> like a vague sorrow , floats from hill to hill <eol> along the vales the doleful accents run <eol> where the white vapours dread the burning sun <eol> while human voices stir the haunted air <eol> one sings “ the plough , ” another warbles “ claire <eol> the happy harvesters , a lightsome throng <eol> dispersing homewards , prove the excellence of song <eol>
