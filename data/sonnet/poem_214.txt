love , loyallest and lordliest born of things <eol> immortal that shouldst be , though all else end <eol> in plighted hearts of fearless friend with friend <eol> whose hand may curb or clip thy plume plucked wings <eol> not grief 's nor time 's : though these be lords and kings <eol> crowned , and their yoke bid vassal passions bend <eol> they may not pierce the spirit of sense , or blend <eol> quick poison with the soul 's live watersprings <eol> the true clear heart whose core is manful trust <eol> fears not that very death may turn to dust <eol> love lit therein as toward a brother born <eol> if one touch make not all its fine gold rust <eol> if one breath blight not all its glad ripe corn <eol> and all its fire be turned to fire of scorn <eol>
