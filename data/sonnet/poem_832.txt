mine eye and heart are at a mortal war <eol> how to divide the conquest of thy sight <eol> mine eye , my heart thy picture 's sight would bar <eol> my heart , mine eye the freedom of that right <eol> my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie <eol> ( a closet never pierced with crystal eyes <eol> but the defendant doth that plea deny <eol> and says in him thy fair appearance lies <eol> to side this title is impanelled <eol> a quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart <eol> and by their verdict is determined <eol> the clear eye 's moiety , and the dear heart 's part <eol> as thus , mine eye 's due is thy outward part <eol> and my heart 's right , thy inward love of heart <eol>
