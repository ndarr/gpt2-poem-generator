let the world 's sharpness like a clasping knife <eol> shut in upon itself and do no harm <eol> in this close hand of love , now soft and warm <eol> and let us hear no sound of human strife <eol> after the click of the shutting . life to life <eol> i lean upon thee , dear , without alarm <eol> and feel as safe as guarded by a charm <eol> against the stab of worldlings , who if rife <eol> are weak to injure . very whitely still <eol> the lilies of our lives may reassure <eol> their blossoms from their roots , accessible <eol> alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer <eol> growing straight , out of man 's reach , on the hill <eol> god only , who made us rich , can make us poor <eol>
