i am not one who much or oft delight <eol> to season my fireside with personal talk <eol> about friends , who live within an easy walk <eol> or neighbours , daily , weekly , in my sight <eol> and , for my chance acquaintance , ladies bright <eol> sons , mothers , maidens withering on the stalk <eol> these all wear out of me , like forms , with chalk <eol> painted on rich men 's floors , for one feast night <eol> better than such discourse doth silence long <eol> long , barren silence , square with my desire <eol> to sit without emotion , hope , or aim <eol> by my half kitchen my half parlour fire <eol> and listen to the flapping of the flame <eol> or kettle , whispering it 's faint undersong <eol>
