that time of life thou mayst in me behold <eol> when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang <eol> upon those boughs which shake against the cold <eol> bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang <eol> in me thou see'st the twilight of such day <eol> as after sunset fadeth in the west <eol> which by and by black night doth take away <eol> death 's second self , that seals up all in rest <eol> in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire <eol> that on the ashes of his youth doth lie <eol> as the death bed whereon it must expire <eol> consumed with that which it was nourished by <eol> this thou perceivest , which makes thy love more strong <eol> to love that well which thou must leave ere long <eol>
