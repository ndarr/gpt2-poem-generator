in the old age black was not counted fair <eol> or if it were it bore not beauty 's name <eol> but now is black beauty 's successive heir <eol> and beauty slandered with a bastard shame <eol> for since each hand hath put on nature 's power <eol> fairing the foul with art 's false borrowed face <eol> sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower <eol> but is profaned , if not lives in disgrace <eol> therefore my mistress â€™ eyes are raven black <eol> her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem <eol> at such who not born fair no beauty lack <eol> slandering creation with a false esteem <eol> yet so they mourn becoming of their woe <eol> that every tongue says beauty should look so <eol>
