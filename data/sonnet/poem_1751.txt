pride of thy race ! before my mental eyes <eol> i see thee , like another alfred rise <eol> see honour splendent on thy ample brow <eol> while thought and genius fill the orbs below <eol> those beaming orbs ! where lofty sweetness shone <eol> and where the soul sate smiling on her throne <eol> depriv 'd too soon of that benignant ray <eol> which impious dahab shudder 'd to survey <eol> pale , bleeding , conquer 'd , dying , and forlorn <eol> i see thee view the wretch with silent scorn <eol> see thy cheek flush at the false tears he shed <eol> and proudly turn away the languid head <eol> with mingled anger , sorrow , and disdain <eol> that he should dare to tempt thy love again <eol>
