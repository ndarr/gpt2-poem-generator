oft in the after days , when thou and i <eol> have fallen from the scope of human view <eol> when , both together , under the sweet sky <eol> we sleep beneath the daisies and the dew <eol> men will recall thy gracious presence bland <eol> conning the pictured sweetness of thy face <eol> will pore o'er paintings by thy plastic hand <eol> and vaunt thy skill and tell thy deeds of grace <eol> oh , may they then , who crown thee with true bays <eol> saying , “ what love unto her son she bore <eol> make this addition to thy perfect praise <eol> “ nor ever yet was mother worshipped more <eol> so shall i live with thee , and thy dear fame <eol> shall link my love unto thine honored name <eol>
