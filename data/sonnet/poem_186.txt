thou , poor heart , sacrificed unto the fairest <eol> hast sent the incense of thy sighs to heaven <eol> and still against her frowns fresh vows repairest <eol> and made thy passions with her beauty even <eol> and you , mine eyes , the agents of my heart <eol> told the dumb message of my hidden grief <eol> and oft , with careful tunes , with silent art <eol> did treat the cruel fair to yield relief <eol> and you , my verse , the advocates of love <eol> have followed hard the process of my case <eol> and urged that title which doth plainly prove <eol> my faith should win , if justice might have place <eol> yet though i see that nought we do can move <eol> â€˜ tis not disdain must make me cease to love <eol>
