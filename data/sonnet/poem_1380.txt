there is a race of men , who master life <eol> their victory being inversely as their strife <eol> who capture by refraining from pursuit <eol> shake not the bough , yet load their hands with fruit <eol> the earth 's high places who attain to fill <eol> by most indomitably sitting still <eol> while others , full upon the fortress hurled <eol> lay fiery siege to the embattled world <eol> of such rude arts their natures feel no need <eol> greatly inert , they lazily succeed <eol> find in the golden mean their proper bliss <eol> and doing nothing , never do amiss <eol> but lapt in men 's good graces live , and die <eol> by all regretted , nobody knows why <eol>
