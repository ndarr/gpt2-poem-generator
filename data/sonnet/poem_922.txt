by the fond name that was his own and mine <eol> the last upon his lips that strove with doom <eol> he called me and i saw the light assume <eol> a sudden glory and around him shine <eol> and nearer now i saw the laureled line <eol> of the august of song before me loom <eol> and knew the voices , erstwhile through the gloom <eol> that whispered and forbade me to repine <eol> and with farewell , a shaft of splendor sank <eol> out of the stars and faded as a flame <eol> and down the night , on clouds of glory , came <eol> the battle seraphs halting rank on rank <eol> and lifted heavenward to heroic peace <eol> he passed and left me hope beyond surcease <eol>
