hear what the desolate rizpah said <eol> as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead <eol> the sons of michal before her lay <eol> and her own fair children , dearer than they <eol> by a death of shame they all had died <eol> and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side <eol> and rizpah , once the loveliest of all <eol> that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul <eol> all wasted with watching and famine now <eol> and scorched by the sun her haggard brow <eol> sat mournfully guarding their corpses there <eol> and murmured a strange and solemn air <eol> the low , heart broken , and wailing strain <eol> of a mother that mourns her children slain <eol>
