in quest of peace great montezuma stands <eol> a sovereign supplicant with lifted hands <eol> brings all his treasure , yields the regal sway <eol> bids vassal millions their new lord obey <eol> and plies the victor with incessant prayer <eol> thro ravaged realms the harmless race to spare <eol> but treasures , tears and sceptres plead in vain <eol> nor threats can move him , nor a world restrain <eol> while blind religion 's prostituted name <eol> and monkish fury guide the sacred flame <eol> o'er crowded fanes their fires unhallow 'd bend <eol> climb the wide roofs , the lofty towers ascend <eol> pour thro the lowering skies the smoky flood <eol> and stain the fields , and quench the blaze in blood <eol>
