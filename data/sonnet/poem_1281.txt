i cannot tell what change hath come to you <eol> to vex your splendid hair . i only know <eol> one grief . the passion left betwixt us two <eol> like some forsaken watchfire , burneth low <eol> â€˜ tis sad to turn and find it dying so <eol> without a hope of resurrection ! yet <eol> o radiant face that found me tired and lone <eol> i shall not for the dear , dead past forget <eol> the sweetest looks of all the summers gone <eol> ah ! time hath made familiar wild regret <eol> for now the leaves are white in last year 's bowers <eol> and now doth sob along the ruined leas <eol> the homeless storm from saddened southern seas <eol> while march sits weeping over withered flowers <eol>
