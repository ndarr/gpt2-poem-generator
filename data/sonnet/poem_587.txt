an arid daylight shines along the beach <eol> dried to a grey monotony of tone <eol> and stranded jelly fish melt soft upon <eol> the sun baked pebbles , far beyond their reach <eol> sparkles a wet , reviving sea . here bleach <eol> the skeletons of fishes , every bone <eol> polished and stark , like traceries of stone <eol> the joints and knuckles hardened each to each <eol> and they are dead while waiting for the sea <eol> the moon pursuing sea , to come again <eol> their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze <eol> only the shells and stones can wait to be <eol> washed bright . for living things , who suffer pain <eol> may not endure till time can bring them ease <eol>
