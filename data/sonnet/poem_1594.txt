i know the sorrows of the last abyss <eol> i walked the cold black pools without a star <eol> i lay on rock of unseen flint and spar <eol> i heard the execrable serpent hiss <eol> i dreamed of sun , fruit tree , and virgin 's kiss <eol> i woke alone with midnight near and far <eol> and everlasting hunger , keen to mar <eol> but i arose , and my reward is this <eol> i am no more one more amid the throng <eol> though name be naught , and lips forever weak <eol> i seem to know at last of mighty song <eol> and with no blush , no tremor on the cheek <eol> i do claim consort with the great and strong <eol> who suffered ill and had the gift to speak <eol>
