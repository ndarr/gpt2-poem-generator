the palid thunderstricken sigh for gain <eol> down an ideal stream they ever float <eol> and sailing on pactolus in a boat <eol> drown soul and sense , while wistfully they strain <eol> weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe <eol> the understream . the wise could he behold <eol> cathedralled caverns of thick ribb Ã¨ d gold <eol> and branching silvers of the central globe <eol> would marvel from so beautiful a sight <eol> how scorn and ruin , pain and hate could flow <eol> but hatred in a gold cave sits below <eol> pleached with her hair , in mail of argent light <eol> shot into gold , a snake her forehead clips <eol> and skins the colour from her trembling lips <eol>
