i live , sweet love , whereas the gentle wind <eol> murmurs with sport in midst of thickest boughs <eol> where loving woodbine doth the harbor bind <eol> and chirping birds do echo forth my vows <eol> where strongest elm can scarce support the vine <eol> and sweetest flowers enameled have the ground <eol> where muses dwell ; and yet hereat repine <eol> that on the earth so rare a place was found <eol> but winds delight , i wish to be content <eol> i praise the woodbine , but i take no joy <eol> i moan the birds that music thus have spent <eol> as for the rest , they breed but mine annoy <eol> live then , fair licia , in this place alone <eol> then shall i joy though all of these were gone <eol>
