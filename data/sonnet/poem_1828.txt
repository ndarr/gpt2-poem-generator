â€˜ dear native brook ! wild streamlet of the west <eol> how many various fated years have passed <eol> what blissful and what anguished hours , since last <eol> i skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast <eol> numbering its light leaps ! yet so deep imprest <eol> sink the sweet scenes of childhood , that mine eyes <eol> i never shut amid the sunny haze <eol> but straight with all their tints , thy waters rise <eol> thy crowning plank , thy margin 's willowy maze <eol> and bedded sand that veined with various dyes <eol> gleamed through thy bright transparence to the gaze <eol> visions of childhood ! oft have ye beguiled <eol> lone manhood 's cares , yet waking fondest sighs <eol> ah ! that once more i were a careless child <eol>
