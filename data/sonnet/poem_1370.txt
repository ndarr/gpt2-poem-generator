dear ladies , though last to receive my oblation <eol> and last in the list of mosaic creation <eol> the last is the best , and the last shall be first <eol> through eve , sayeth moses , old adam was cursed <eol> but i cannot agree with you , moses , that adam <eol> sinned and fell through the gentle persuasion of madam <eol> the victim , no doubt , of egyptian flirtation <eol> you mistook your chagrin for divine inspiration <eol> and condemned all the sex without proof or probation <eol> as we rhymsters mistake the moonbeams that elate us <eol> for flashes of wit or the holy afflatus <eol> and imagine we hear the applause of a nation <eol> but all honest men who are married and blest <eol> will agree that the last work of god is the best <eol>
