and hither does one poet sometimes row <eol> his pinnace , a small vagrant barge , up piled <eol> with plenteous store of heath and wither 'd fern <eol> a lading which he with his sickle cuts <eol> among the mountains , and beneath this roof <eol> he makes his summer couch , and here at noon <eol> spreads out his limbs , while , yet unborn , the sheep <eol> panting beneath the burthen of their wool <eol> lie round him , even as if they were a part <eol> of his own household : nor , while from his bed <eol> he through that door place looks toward the lake <eol> and to the stirring breezes , does he want <eol> creations lovely as the work of sleep <eol> fair sights , and visions of romantic joy <eol>
