o pope ! instructor of my studious days <eol> who fix 'd my steps in virtue 's early ways <eol> on whom our labours , and our hopes depend <eol> thou more than patron , and ev'n more than friend <eol> above all flattery , all thirst of gain <eol> and mortal but in sickness , and in pain <eol> thou taught'st old satire nobler fruits to bear <eol> and check 'd her licence with a moral care <eol> thou gav'st the thought new beauties not its own <eol> and touch 'd the verse with graces yet unknown <eol> each lawless branch thy level eye survey 'd <eol> and still corrected nature as she stray 'd <eol> warm 'd boileau 's sense with britain 's genuine fire <eol> and added softness to tasson Ã¨' s lyre <eol>
