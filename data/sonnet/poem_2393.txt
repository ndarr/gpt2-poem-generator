a wrinkled , crabb Ã© d man they picture thee <eol> old winter , with a rugged beard as gray <eol> as the long moss upon the apple tree <eol> blue lipt , an ice drop at thy sharp blue nose <eol> close muffled up , and on thy dreary way <eol> plodding alone through sleet and drifting snows <eol> they should have drawn thee by the high heapt hearth <eol> old winter ! seated in thy great armed chair <eol> watching the children at their christmas mirth <eol> or circled by them as thy lips declare <eol> some merry jest , or tale of murder dire <eol> or troubled spirit that disturbs the night <eol> pausing at times to rouse the smouldering fire <eol> or taste the old october brown and bright <eol>
