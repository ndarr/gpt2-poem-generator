thou drowsy god , whose blurred eyes , half awink <eol> muse on me â€”, drifting out upon thy dreams <eol> i lave my soul as in enchanted streams <eol> where revelling satyrs pipe along the brink <eol> and tipsy with the melody they drink <eol> uplift their dangling hooves , and down the beams <eol> of sunshine dance like motes . thy languor seems <eol> an ocean depth of love wherein i sink <eol> like some fond argonaut , right willingly <eol> because of wooing eyes upturned to mine <eol> and siren arms that coil their sorcery <eol> about my neck , with kisses so divine <eol> the heavens reel above me , and the sea <eol> swallows and licks its wet lips over me <eol>
