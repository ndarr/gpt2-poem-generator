before the mountains were brought forth , before <eol> earth and the world were made , then god was god <eol> and god will still be god , when flames shall roar <eol> round earth and heaven dissolving at his nod <eol> and this god is our god , even while his rod <eol> of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore <eol> and this god is our god for evermore <eol> through life , through death , while clod returns to clod <eol> for though he slay us we will trust in him <eol> we will flock home to him by divers ways <eol> yea , though he slay us we will vaunt his praise <eol> serving and loving with the cherubim <eol> watching and loving with the seraphim <eol> our very selves his praise through endless days <eol>
