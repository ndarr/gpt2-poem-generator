sweet heart , forgive me for thine own sweet sake <eol> whose kind blithe soul such seas of sorrow swam <eol> and for my love 's sake , powerless as i am <eol> for love to praise thee , or like thee to make <eol> music of mirth where hearts less pure would break <eol> less pure than thine , our life unspotted lamb <eol> things hatefullest thou hadst not heart to damn <eol> nor wouldst have set thine heel on this dead snake <eol> let worms consume its memory with its tongue <eol> the fang that stabbed fair truth , the lip that stung <eol> men 's memories uncorroded with its breath <eol> forgive me , that with bitter words like his <eol> i mix the gentlest english name that is <eol> the tenderest held of all that know not death <eol>
