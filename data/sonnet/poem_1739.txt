by red ripe mouth and brown , luxurious eyes <eol> of her i love , by all your sweetness shed <eol> in far , fair days , on one whose memory flies <eol> to faithless lights , and gracious speech gainsaid <eol> i pray you , when yon river path i tread <eol> make with the woodlands some soft compromise <eol> lest they should vex me into fruitless sighs <eol> with visions of a woman 's gleaming head <eol> for every green and golden hearted thing <eol> that gathers beauty in that shining place <eol> beloved of beams and wooed by wind and wing <eol> is rife with glimpses of her marvellous face <eol> and in the whispers of the lips of spring <eol> the music of her lute like voice i trace <eol>
