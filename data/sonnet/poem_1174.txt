i hope and fear , i pray and hold my peace <eol> now freeze my thoughts and straight they fry again <eol> i now admire and straight my wonders cease <eol> i loose my bonds and yet myself restrain <eol> this likes me most that leaves me discontent <eol> my courage serves and yet my heart doth fail <eol> my will doth climb whereas my hopes are spent <eol> i laugh at love , yet when he comes i quail <eol> the more i strive , the duller bide i still <eol> i would be thralled , and yet i freedom love <eol> i would redress , yet hourly feed mine ill <eol> i would repine , and dare not once reprove <eol> and for my love i am bereft of power <eol> and strengthless strive my weakness to devour <eol>
