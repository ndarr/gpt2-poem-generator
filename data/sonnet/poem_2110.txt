honora , shou 'd that cruel time arrive <eol> when ‘ gainst my truth thou should'st my errors poize <eol> scorning remembrance of our vanish 'd joys <eol> when for the love warm looks , in which i live <eol> but cold respect must greet me , that shall give <eol> no tender glance , no kind regretful sighs <eol> when thou shalt pass me with averted eyes <eol> feigning thou see'st me not , to sting , and grieve <eol> and sicken my sad heart , i cou 'd not bear <eol> such dire eclipse of thy soul cheering rays <eol> i cou 'd not learn my struggling heart to tear <eol> from thy lov 'd form , that thro ’ my memory strays <eol> nor in the pale horizon of despair <eol> endure the wintry and the darken 'd days <eol>
