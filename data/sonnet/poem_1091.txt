seven sweet singing birds up in a tree <eol> seven swift sailing ships white upon the sea <eol> seven bright weather cocks shining in the sun <eol> seven slim race horses ready for a run <eol> seven gold butterflies , flitting overhead <eol> seven red roses blowing in a garden bed <eol> seven white lilies , with honey bees inside them <eol> seven round rainbows with clouds to divide them <eol> seven pretty little girls with sugar on their lips <eol> seven witty little boys , whom everybody tips <eol> seven nice fathers , to call little maids joys <eol> seven nice mothers , to kiss the little boys <eol> seven nights running i dreamt it all plain <eol> with bread and jam for supper i could dream it all again <eol>
