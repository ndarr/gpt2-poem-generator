in those good days when we were young and wise <eol> you spake to music , you with the thoughtful eyes <eol> and god looked down from heaven , pleased to hear <eol> a young man 's song arise so firm and clear <eol> has fancy died ? the morning star gone cold <eol> why are you silent ? have we grown so old <eol> must i alone keep playing ? will not you <eol> lord of the measures , string your lyre anew <eol> lover of greece , is this the richest store <eol> you bring us ,â€” withered leaves and dusty lore <eol> and broken vases widowed of their wine <eol> to brand you pedant while you stand divine <eol> decorous words beseem the learned lip <eol> but poets have the nicer scholarship <eol>
