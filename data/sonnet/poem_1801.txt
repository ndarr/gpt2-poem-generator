hopeless ! despairless ! like that indian wise <eol> free of desire , save no desire to know <eol> to gain that sweet nirvana each one tries <eol> thinks to assuage soul wearing passion so <eol> from the white rest , the ante natal bliss <eol> not loth , the wondrous wondering soul awakes <eol> now drawn to that illusion , now to this <eol> with gathering strength each devious pathway takes <eol> till at the noon of life his aims decline <eol> evermore earthward bend the tiring eyes <eol> evermore earthward , till with no surprise <eol> they see nirvana from earth 's bosom shine <eol> the still kind mother holds her child again <eol> in blank desirelessness without a stain <eol>
