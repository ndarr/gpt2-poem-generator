now that we 've done our best and worst , and parted <eol> i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend <eol> ( o heart , i do not dare go empty hearted <eol> i 'll think of love in books , love without end <eol> women with child , content ; and old men sleeping <eol> and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain <eol> and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping <eol> and the young heavens , forgetful after rain <eol> and evening hush , broken by homing wings <eol> and song 's nobility and wisdom holy <eol> that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things <eol> lovely and durable , and taste them slowly <eol> one after one , like tasting a sweet food <eol> i have need to busy my heart with quietude <eol>
