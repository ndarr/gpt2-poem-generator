there hung a calm and solemn sunshine round <eol> those mighty monuments , a hushing sound <eol> in the still air that circled them which stole <eol> like music of past times into my soul <eol> i thought what myriads of the wise and brave <eol> and beautiful had sunk into the grave <eol> since earth first saw these wonders — and i said <eol> “ are things eternal only for the dead <eol> “ hath man no loftier hope than this which dooms <eol> “ his only lasting trophies to be tombs <eol> “ but ‘ tis not so — earth , heaven , all nature shows <eol> “ he may become immortal — may unclose <eol> “ the wings within him wrapt , and proudly rise <eol> “ redeemed from earth , a creature of the skies <eol>
