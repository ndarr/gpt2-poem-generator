as are the sands , fair licia , on the shore <eol> or colored flowers , garlands of the spring <eol> or as the frosts not seen , not felt before <eol> or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring <eol> as twinkling stars , the tinsel of the night <eol> or as the fish that gallop in the seas <eol> as airs each part that still escapes our sight <eol> so are my sighs , controllers of my ease <eol> yet these are such as needs must have an end <eol> for things finite none else hath nature done <eol> only the sighs , which from my heart i send <eol> will never cease , but where they first begun <eol> accept them , sweet , as incense due to thee <eol> for you immortal made them so to be <eol>
