i know not why , but all this weary day <eol> suggested by no definite grief or pain <eol> sad fancies have been flitting through my brain <eol> now it has been a vessel losing way <eol> rounding a stormy headland ; now a gray <eol> dull waste of clouds above a wintry main <eol> and then , a banner , drooping in the rain <eol> and meadows beaten into bloody clay <eol> strolling at random with this shadowy woe <eol> at heart , i chanced to wander hither ! lo <eol> a league of desolate marsh land , with its lush <eol> hot grasses in a noisome , tide left bed <eol> and faint , warm airs , that rustle in the hush <eol> like whispers round the body of the dead <eol>
