thus mourn 'd the hapless man : a thundering sound <eol> roll 'd thro the shuddering walls and shook the ground <eol> o'er all the dungeon , where black arches bend <eol> the roofs unfold , and streams of light descend <eol> the growing splendor fills the astonish 'd room <eol> and gales etherial breathe a glad perfume <eol> robed in the radiance , moves a form serene <eol> of human structure , but of heavenly mien <eol> near to the prisoner 's couch he takes his stand <eol> and waves , in sign of peace , his holy hand <eol> tall rose his stature , youth 's endearing grace <eol> adorn 'd his limbs and brighten 'd in his face <eol> loose o'er his locks the star of evening hung <eol> and sounds melodious moved his cheerful tongue <eol>
