if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks <eol> what shining of pent glories , what new grace <eol> had burst upon us from the great earth 's face <eol> how had we read , as in new languaged books <eol> clear love of god in lone retreating nooks <eol> a lily , as thy hand its form would trace <eol> were plainly seen god 's child , of lower race <eol> and , o my heart , blue hills ! and grassy brooks <eol> thy soul lay to all undulations bare <eol> answering in waves . each morn the sun did rise <eol> and god 's world woke beneath life giving skies <eol> thou sawest clear thy father 's meanings there <eol> â€˜ mid earth 's ideal , and expressions rare <eol> the ideal man , with the eternal eyes <eol>
