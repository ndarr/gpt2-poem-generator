what seekest thou far in the unknown land <eol> in hope i follow joy gone on before <eol> in hope and fear persistent more and more <eol> as the dry desert lengthens out its sand <eol> whilst day and night i carry in my hand <eol> the golden key to ope the golden door <eol> of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore <eol> for the long journey that must make no stand <eol> and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee <eol> lo , this is love that walketh at my right <eol> one exile holds us both , and we are bound <eol> to selfsame home joys in the land of light <eol> weeping thou walkest with him ; weepeth he <eol> some sobbing weep , some weep and make no sound <eol>
