i have done i know not what ,â€” what have i done <eol> my brother 's blood , my brother 's soul , doth cry <eol> and i find no defence , find no reply <eol> no courage more to run this race i run <eol> not knowing what i have done , have left undone <eol> ah me , these awful unknown hours that fly <eol> fruitless it may be , fleeting fruitless by <eol> rank with death savor underneath the sun <eol> for what avails it that i did not know <eol> the deed i did ? what profits me the plea <eol> that had i known i had not wronged him so <eol> lord jesus christ , my god , him pity thou <eol> lord , if it may be , pity also me <eol> in judgment pity , and in death , and now <eol>
