this bronze doth keep the very form and mold <eol> of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he <eol> that brow all wisdom , all benignity <eol> that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold <eol> like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold <eol> that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea <eol> for storms to beat on ; the lone agony <eol> those silent , patient lips too well foretold <eol> yes , this is he who ruled a world of men <eol> as might some prophet of the elder day <eol> brooding above the tempest and the fray <eol> with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken <eol> a power was his beyond the touch of art <eol> or arm Ã¨ d strength : his pure and mighty heart <eol>
