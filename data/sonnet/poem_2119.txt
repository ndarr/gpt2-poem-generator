could i outwear my present state of woe <eol> with one brief winter , and indue i â€™ the spring <eol> hues of fresh youth , and mightily outgrow <eol> the wan dark coil of faded suffering <eol> forth in the pride of beauty issuing <eol> a sheeny snake , the light of vernal bowers <eol> moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers <eol> and watered vallies where the young birds sing <eol> could i thus hope my lost delights renewing <eol> i straightly would commend the tears to creep <eol> from my charged lids ; but inwardly i weep <eol> some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing <eol> this to itself hath drawn the frozen rain <eol> from my cold eyes and melted it again <eol>
