o humble me ! i cannot bide the joy <eol> that in my saviour 's presence ever flows <eol> may i be lowly , lest it may destroy <eol> the peace his childlike spirit ever knows <eol> i would not speak thy word , but by thee stand <eol> while thou dost to thine erring children speak <eol> o help me but to keep his own command <eol> and in my strength to feel me ever weak <eol> then in thy presence shall i humbly stay <eol> nor lose the life of love he came to give <eol> and find at last the life , the truth , the way <eol> to where with him thy blessed servants live <eol> and walk forever in the path of truth <eol> a servant , yet a son ; a sire and yet a youth <eol>
