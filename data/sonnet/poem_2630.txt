love , you did give all i asked , i think <eol> more than i merit , yes , by many times <eol> and perfect eyes , and more than perfect mouth <eol> but had you — oh , with the same perfect brow <eol> and the low voice my soul hears , as a bird <eol> the fowler 's pipe , and follows to the snare <eol> had you , with these the same , but brought a mind <eol> some women do so . had the mouth there urged <eol> “ god and the glory ! never care for gain <eol> the present by the future , what is that <eol> live for fame , side by side with agnolo <eol> rafael is waiting : up to god , all three <eol> i might have done it for you . so it seems <eol> perhaps not . all is as god overrules <eol>
