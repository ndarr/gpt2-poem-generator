what potions have i drunk of siren tears <eol> distilled from limbecks foul as hell within <eol> applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears <eol> still losing when i saw my self to win <eol> what wretched errors hath my heart committed <eol> whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never <eol> how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted <eol> in the distraction of this madding fever <eol> o benefit of ill , now i find true <eol> that better is , by evil still made better <eol> and ruined love when it is built anew <eol> grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater <eol> so i return rebuked to my content <eol> and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent <eol>
