i think if you had loved me when i wanted <eol> if i 'd looked up one day , and seen your eyes <eol> and found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted <eol> and your brown face , that 's full of pity and wise <eol> flushed suddenly ; the white godhead in new fear <eol> intolerably so struggling , and so shamed <eol> most holy and far , if you 'd come all too near <eol> if earth had seen earth 's lordliest wild limbs tamed <eol> shaken , and trapped , and shivering , for my touch <eol> myself should i have slain ? or that foul you <eol> but this the strange gods , who had given so much <eol> to have seen and known you , this they might not do <eol> one last shame 's spared me , one black word 's unspoken <eol> and i 'm alone ; and you have not awoken <eol>
