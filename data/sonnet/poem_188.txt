it is not with a hope my feeble praise <eol> can add one moment 's honor to thy own <eol> that with thy mighty name i grace these lays <eol> i seek to glorify myself alone <eol> for that some precious favor thou hast shown <eol> to my endeavor in a bygone time <eol> and by this token i would have it known <eol> thou art my friend , and friendly to my rhyme <eol> it is my dear ambition now to climb <eol> still higher in thy thought ,â€” if my bold pen <eol> may thrust on contemplations more sublime <eol> but i am thirsty for thy praise , for when <eol> we gain applauses from the great in name <eol> we seem to be partakers of their fame <eol>
