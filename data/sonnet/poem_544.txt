methinks i hear the thoughtful reader ask <eol> â€œ why was the man , at once , not ta'en to task <eol> why did the other men not take a part <eol> with that poor boy , and show a feeling heart <eol> i am informed they all enjoyed the joke <eol> not one reproachful word they ever spoke <eol> i blush to think that any of my trade <eol> should of such monsters ever be afraid <eol> the very thought still makes my blood to boil <eol> and shuddering , from such thoughts i back recoil <eol> i would have dragged the fiend unto a jail <eol> or had him fastened to a wagon 's tail <eol> laid bare his back , and let the lash descend <eol> and , doing this , would still my act defend <eol>
