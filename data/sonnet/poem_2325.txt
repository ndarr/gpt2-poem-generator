the grecian muse has all their gods survived <eol> nor jove at us , nor phoebus is arrived <eol> frail deities ! which first the poets made <eol> and then invoked , to give their fancies aid <eol> yet if they still divert us with their rage <eol> what may be hoped for in a better age <eol> when not from helicon 's imagined spring <eol> but sacred writ , we borrow what we sing <eol> this with the fabric of the world begun <eol> elder than light , and shall outlast the sun <eol> before this oracle , like dagon , all <eol> the false pretenders , delphos , ammon , fall <eol> long since despised and silent , they afford <eol> honour and triumph to th'eternal word <eol>
