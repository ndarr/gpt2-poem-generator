of thetis i sing with her locks of gold shine <eol> the daughter of nereus , lord of the brine <eol> to peleus wedded , by jove 's high decree <eol> i sing her , the venus so fair of the sea <eol> of the spearman tremendous , the mars of the fight <eol> thunderbolt of old greece , she was quickly made light <eol> of achilles divine , to whom pyrrha an heir <eol> the boy neoptolemus , gladly did bear <eol> the destroyer of trojans , of grecians the shield <eol> thy protection to us , neoptolemus yield <eol> who blessed doth slumber in pythia 's green plain <eol> to accept this oblation of hymns from us deign <eol> and each peril drive far from our city benign <eol> of thetis i sing with her locks of gold shine <eol>
