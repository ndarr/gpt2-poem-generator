i hate the very noise of troublous man <eol> who did and does me all the harm he can <eol> free from the world i would a prisoner be <eol> and my own shadow all my company <eol> and lonely see the shooting stars appear <eol> worlds rushing into judgment all the year <eol> o lead me onward to the loneliest shade <eol> the darkest place that quiet ever made <eol> where kingcups grow most beauteous to behold <eol> and shut up green and open into gold <eol> farewell to poesy — and leave the will <eol> take all the world away — and leave me still <eol> the mirth and music of a woman 's voice <eol> that bids the heart be happy and rejoice <eol>
