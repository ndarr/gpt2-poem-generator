i dream of you to wake : would that i might <eol> dream of you and not wake but slumber on <eol> nor find with dreams the dear companion gone <eol> as summer ended summer birds take flight <eol> in happy dreams i hold you full in sight <eol> i blush again who waking look so wan <eol> brighter than sunniest day that ever shone <eol> in happy dreams your smile makes day of night <eol> thus only in a dream we are at one <eol> thus only in a dream we give and take <eol> the faith that maketh rich who take or give <eol> if thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake <eol> to die were surely sweeter than to live <eol> though there be nothing new beneath the sun <eol>
