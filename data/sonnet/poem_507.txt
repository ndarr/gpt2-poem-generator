o me ! what eyes hath love put in my head <eol> which have no correspondence with true sight <eol> or if they have , where is my judgment fled <eol> that censures falsely what they see aright <eol> if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote <eol> what means the world to say it is not so <eol> if it be not , then love doth well denote <eol> love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no <eol> how can it ? o how can love 's eye be true <eol> that is so vexed with watching and with tears <eol> no marvel then though i mistake my view <eol> the sun it self sees not , till heaven clears <eol> o cunning love , with tears thou keep'st me blind <eol> lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find <eol>
