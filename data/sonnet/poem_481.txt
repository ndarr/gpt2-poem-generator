mild arch of promise ! on the evening sky <eol> thou shinest fair with many a lovely ray <eol> each in the other melting . much mine eye <eol> delights to linger on thee ; for the day <eol> changeful and many weather 'd , seem 'd to smile <eol> flashing brief splendor thro â€™ its clouds awhile <eol> that deepen 'd dark anon and fell in rain <eol> but pleasant is it now to pause , and view <eol> thy various tints of frail and watery hue <eol> and think the storm shall not return again <eol> such is the smile that piety bestows <eol> on the good man 's pale cheek , when he in peace <eol> departing gently from a world of woes <eol> anticipates the realm where sorrows cease <eol>
