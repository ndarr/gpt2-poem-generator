how do i love thee ? let me count the ways <eol> i love thee to the depth and breadth and height <eol> my soul can reach , when feeling out of sight <eol> for the ends of being and ideal grace <eol> i love thee to the level of everyday 's <eol> most quiet need , by sun and candlelight <eol> i love thee freely , as men strive for right <eol> i love thee purely , as they turn from praise <eol> i love thee with the passion put to use <eol> in my old griefs , and with my childhood 's faith <eol> i love thee with a love i seemed to lose <eol> with my lost saints ,— i love thee with the breath <eol> smiles , tears , of all my life !— and , if god choose <eol> i shall but love thee better after death <eol>
