hark ! how the bitter winter breezes blow <eol> round the sharp rocks and o'er the half lifted wave <eol> while all the rocky woodland branches rave <eol> shrill with the piercing cold , and every cave <eol> along the icy water margin low <eol> rings bubbling with the whirling overflow <eol> and sharp the echoes answer distant cries <eol> of dawning daylight and the dim sunrise <eol> and the gloom coloured clouds that stain the skies <eol> with pictures of a warmth , and frozen glow <eol> spread over endless fields of sheeted snow <eol> and white untrodden mountains shining cold <eol> and muffled footpaths winding thro â€™ the wold <eol> o'er which those wintry gusts cease not to howl and blow <eol>
