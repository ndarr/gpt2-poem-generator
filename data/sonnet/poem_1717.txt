no man can understand the sea , until <eol> he knows all passions of the senses ; all <eol> the great emotions of the heart ; and each <eol> exalted aspiration of the soul <eol> then may he sit beside the sea and say <eol> â€˜ i , too , have flung myself against the rocks <eol> and kissed their flinty brows with no return <eol> and fallen spent upon unfeeling sands <eol> i , too , have gone forth yearning , to far shores <eol> seeking that something which would bring content <eol> and finding only what i took away <eol> and i have looked up , through the veil of skies <eol> when all the world was still , and understood <eol> that i am one with nature and with god <eol>
