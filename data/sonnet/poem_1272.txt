my glass shall not persuade me i am old <eol> so long as youth and thou are of one date <eol> but when in thee time 's furrows i behold <eol> then look i death my days should expiate <eol> for all that beauty that doth cover thee <eol> is but the seemly raiment of my heart <eol> which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me <eol> how can i then be elder than thou art <eol> o therefore love be of thyself so wary <eol> as i not for my self , but for thee will <eol> bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary <eol> as tender nurse her babe from faring ill <eol> presume not on thy heart when mine is slain <eol> thou gav'st me thine not to give back again <eol>
