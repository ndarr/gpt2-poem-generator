life ever seems as from its present site <eol> it aimed to lure us . mountains of the past <eol> it melts , with all their crags and caverns vast <eol> into a purple cloud ! across the night <eol> which hides what is to be , it shoots a light <eol> all rosy with the yet unrisen dawn <eol> not the near daisies , but yon distant height <eol> attracts us , lying on this emerald lawn <eol> and always , be the landscape what it may <eol> blue , misty hill or sweep of glimmering plain <eol> it is the eye 's endeavor still to gain <eol> the fine , faint limit of the bounding day <eol> god , haply , in this mystic mode , would fain <eol> hint of a happier home , far , far away <eol>
