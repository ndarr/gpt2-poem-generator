i have heard the pigeons of the seven woods <eol> make their faint thunder , and the garden bees <eol> hum in the lime tree flowers ; and put away <eol> the unavailing outcries and the old bitterness <eol> that empty the heart . i have forgot awhile <eol> tara uprooted , and new commonness <eol> upon the throne and crying about the streets <eol> and hanging its paper flowers from post to post <eol> because it is alone of all things happy <eol> i am contented for i know that quiet <eol> wanders laughing and eating her wild heart <eol> among pigeons and bees , while that great archer <eol> who but awaits his hour to shoot , still hangs <eol> a cloudy quiver over parc na lee <eol>
