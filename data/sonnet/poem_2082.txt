when i have fears that i may cease to be <eol> before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain <eol> before high piled books , in charactery <eol> hold like rich garners the full ripen 'd grain <eol> when i behold , upon the night 's starr 'd face <eol> huge cloudy symbols of a high romance <eol> and think that i may never live to trace <eol> their shadows , with the magic hand of chance <eol> and when i feel , fair creature of an hour <eol> that i shall never look upon thee more <eol> never have relish in the faery power <eol> of unreflecting love ;â€” then on the shore <eol> of the wide world i stand alone , and think <eol> till love and fame to nothingness do sink <eol>
