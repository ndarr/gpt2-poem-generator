o watcher at the guardless gate of kings <eol> o doorkeeper that serving at their feast <eol> hast in thine hand their doomsday drink , and seest <eol> with eyeless sight the soul of unseen things <eol> thou in whose ear the dumb time coming sings <eol> death , priest and king that makest of king and priest <eol> a name , a dream , a less thing than the least <eol> hover awhile above him with closed wings <eol> till the coiled soul , an evil snake shaped beast <eol> eat its base bodily lair of flesh away <eol> if haply , or ever its cursed life have ceased <eol> or ever thy cold hands cover his head <eol> from sight of france and freedom and broad day <eol> he may see these and wither and be dead <eol>
