o world , thou choosest not the better part <eol> it is not wisdom to be only wise <eol> and on the inward vision close the eyes <eol> but it is wisdom to believe the heart <eol> columbus found a world , and had no chart <eol> save one that faith deciphered in the skies <eol> to trust the soul 's invincible surmise <eol> was all his science and his only art <eol> our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine <eol> that lights the pathway but one step ahead <eol> across a void of mystery and dread <eol> bid , then , the tender light of faith to shine <eol> by which alone the mortal heart is led <eol> unto the thinking of the thought divine <eol>
