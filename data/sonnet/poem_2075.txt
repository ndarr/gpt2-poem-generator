i am so weary with the burden old <eol> of foregone faults , and power of custom base <eol> that much i fear to perish from the ways <eol> and fall into my enemy 's grim fold <eol> true , a high friend , to free me , not with gold <eol> came , of ineffable and utmost grace <eol> then straightway vanished from before my face <eol> so that in vain i strive him to behold <eol> but his voice yet comes echoing below <eol> o ye that labour , the way open lies <eol> come unto me lest some one shut the gate <eol> — what heavenly grace — what love will — or what fate <eol> the pinions of a dove on me bestow <eol> that i may rest , and from the earth arise <eol>
