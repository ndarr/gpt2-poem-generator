the poetry of earth is never dead <eol> when all the birds are faint with the hot sun <eol> and hide in cooling trees , a voice will run <eol> from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead <eol> that is the grasshopper 's — he takes the lead <eol> in summer luxury ,— he has never done <eol> with his delights , for when tired out with fun <eol> he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed <eol> the poetry of earth is ceasing never <eol> on a lone winter evening , when the frost <eol> has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills <eol> the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever <eol> and seems to one in drowsiness half lost <eol> the grasshopper 's among the grassy hills <eol>
