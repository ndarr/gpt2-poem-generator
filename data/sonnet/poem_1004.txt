the bubbling brook doth leap when i come by <eol> because my feet find measure with its call <eol> the birds know when the friend they love is nigh <eol> for i am known to them , both great and small <eol> the flower that on the lonely hillside grows <eol> expects me there when spring its bloom has given <eol> and many a tree and bush my wanderings knows <eol> and e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven <eol> for he who with his maker walks aright <eol> shall be their lord as adam was before <eol> his ear shall catch each sound with new delight <eol> each object wear the dress that then it wore <eol> and he , as when erect in soul he stood <eol> hear from his father 's lips that all is good <eol>
