look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest <eol> now is the time that face should form another <eol> whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest <eol> thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother <eol> for where is she so fair whose uneared womb <eol> disdains the tillage of thy husbandry <eol> or who is he so fond will be the tomb <eol> of his self love to stop posterity <eol> thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee <eol> calls back the lovely april of her prime <eol> so thou through windows of thine age shalt see <eol> despite of wrinkles this thy golden time <eol> but if thou live remembered not to be <eol> die single and thine image dies with thee <eol>
