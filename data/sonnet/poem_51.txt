between the two white breasts of her we love <eol> a dewy blushing rose will sometimes spring <eol> thus nonnenwerth like an enchanted thing <eol> rises mid stream the crystal depths above <eol> on either side the waters heave and swell <eol> but all is calm within the little isle <eol> content it is to give its holy smile <eol> and bless with peace the lives that in it dwell <eol> most dear on the dark grass beneath its bower <eol> of kindred trees embracing branch and bough <eol> to dream of fairy foot and sudden flower <eol> or haply with a twilight on the brow <eol> to muse upon the legendary hour <eol> and roland 's lonely love and hildegard 's sad vow <eol>
