all day i 've bent my heart beneath the yoke <eol> of goading toil , remembering to forget <eol> to still upon my lips his kiss that woke <eol> me in elysian love one word has broke <eol> one stinging word of severance and regret <eol> all day i 've blotted from my eyes his face <eol> but now at evening tide it comes again <eol> and memories into my darkened soul <eol> rush as the stars into high heaven 's space <eol> as the bright stars ! but , ah , tomorrow ! when <eol> once more i must forget and see life 's goal <eol> that was so green , with sering laurel hung <eol> tomorrow and tomorrow ! till is wrung <eol> peace from the piteous hours i strive among <eol>
