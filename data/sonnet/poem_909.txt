like a beautiful face looking ever at me <eol> a pure bright moon cometh over the sea <eol> and i stand on the crags , and hear the falls <eol> go tumbling down , through the black river walls <eol> and the heart of the gorge is rent with the cry <eol> of the pent up winds in their agony <eol> you are far from me , dear , where i watch and wait <eol> like a weary bird for a long lost mate <eol> and my life is as dull as the sluggish stream <eol> feeling its way through a world of dream <eol> for here is a waste of darkness and fear <eol> and i call and i call , but no one will hear <eol> o darling of mine , do you ever yearn <eol> for a something lost , which will never return <eol>
