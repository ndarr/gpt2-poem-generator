degenerate douglas ! oh , the unworthy lord <eol> whom mere despite of heart could so far please <eol> and love of havoc ( for with such disease <eol> fame taxes him ) that he could send forth word <eol> to level with the dust a noble horde <eol> a brotherhood of venerable trees <eol> leaving an ancient dome , and towers like these <eol> beggared and outraged !â€” many hearts deplor 'd <eol> the fate of those old trees ; and oft with pain <eol> the traveller , at this day , will stop and gaze <eol> on wrongs , which nature scarcely seems to heed <eol> for shelter 'd places , bosoms , nooks and bays <eol> and the pure mountains , and the gentle tweed <eol> and the green silent pastures , yet remain <eol>
