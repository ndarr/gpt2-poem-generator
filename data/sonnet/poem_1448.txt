good kosciusko , thy great name alone <eol> is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling <eol> it comes upon us like the glorious pealing <eol> of the wide spheres â€” an everlasting tone <eol> and now it tells me , that in worlds unknown <eol> the names of heroes , burst from clouds concealing <eol> and changed to harmonies , for ever stealing <eol> through cloudless blue , and round each silver throne <eol> it tells me too , that on a happy day <eol> when some good spirit walks upon the earth <eol> thy name with alfred 's , and the great of yore <eol> gently commingling , gives tremendous birth <eol> to a loud hymn , that sounds far , far away <eol> to where the great god lives for evermore <eol>
