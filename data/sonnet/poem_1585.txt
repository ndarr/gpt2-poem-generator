sweet wreck of loveliness ! alas , how soon <eol> the sad brief summer of thy joys hath fled <eol> how sorrow 's friendship for thy hapless doom <eol> thy beauty faded , and thy hopes all dead <eol> oh ! â€˜ twas that beauty 's pow'r which first destroy 'd <eol> thy mind 's serenity ; its charms but led <eol> the faithless friend , that thy pure love enjoy 'd <eol> to tear the blooming blossom from its bed <eol> how reason shudders at thy frenzied air <eol> to see thee smile , with fancy 's dreams possess 'd <eol> or shrink , the frozen image of despair <eol> or love enraptur 'd , chaunt thy griefs to rest <eol> oh ! cease that mournful voice , poor suff'ring child <eol> my heart but bleeds to hear thy musings wild <eol>
