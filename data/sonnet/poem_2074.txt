‘ tis bed time ; say your hymn , and bid “ good night <eol> “ god bless mamma , papa , and dear ones all <eol> your half shut eyes beneath your eye lids fall <eol> another minute you will shut them quite <eol> yes , i will carry you , put out the light <eol> and tuck you up , although you are so tall <eol> what will you give me , sleepy one , and call <eol> my wages , if i settle you all right <eol> i laid her golden curls upon my arm <eol> i drew her little feet within my hand <eol> her rosy palms were joined in trustful bliss <eol> her heart next mine , beat gently , soft and warm <eol> she nestled to me , and , by love 's command <eol> paid me my precious wages ,— baby 's kiss <eol>
