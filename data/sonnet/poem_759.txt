beauty , sweet love , is like the morning dew <eol> whose short refresh upon the tender green <eol> cheers for a time but till the sun doth show <eol> and straight â€˜ tis gone as it had never been <eol> soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish <eol> short is the glory of the blushing rose <eol> the hue which thou so carefully dost nourish <eol> yet which at length thou must be forced to lose <eol> when thou , surcharged with burden of thy years <eol> shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth <eol> and that in beauty 's lease expired appears <eol> the date of age , the kalends of our death <eol> but ah ! no more , this must not be foretold <eol> for women grieve to think they must be old <eol>
