love is a breach in the walls , a broken gate <eol> where that comes in that shall not go again <eol> love sells the proud heart 's citadel to fate <eol> they have known shame , who love unloved . even then <eol> when two mouths , thirsty each for each , find slaking <eol> and agony 's forgot , and hushed the crying <eol> of credulous hearts , in heaven â€” such are but taking <eol> their own poor dreams within their arms , and lying <eol> each in his lonely night , each with a ghost <eol> some share that night . but they know love grows colder <eol> grows false and dull , that was sweet lies at most <eol> astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder <eol> but darkens , and dies out from kiss to kiss <eol> all this is love ; and all love is but this <eol>
