if i leave all for thee , wilt thou exchange <eol> and be all to me ? shall i never miss <eol> home talk and blessing and the common kiss <eol> that comes to each in turn , nor count it strange <eol> when i look up , to drop on a new range <eol> of walls and floors , another home than this <eol> nay , wilt thou fill that place by me which is <eol> filled by dead eyes too tender to know change <eol> that 's hardest . if to conquer love , has tried <eol> to conquer grief , tries more , as all things prove <eol> for grief indeed is love and grief beside <eol> alas , i have grieved so i am hard to love <eol> yet love me â€” wilt thou ? open thy heart wide <eol> and fold within , the wet wings of thy dove <eol>
