lo ! o'er the welkin the tempestuous clouds <eol> successive fly , and the loud piping wind <eol> rocks the poor sea boy on the dripping shrouds <eol> while the pale pilot , o'er the helm reclined <eol> lists to the changeful storm : and as he plies <eol> his wakeful task , he oft bethinks him , sad <eol> of wife , and little home , and chubby lad <eol> and the half strangled tear bedews his eyes <eol> i , on the deck , musing on themes forlorn <eol> view the drear tempest , and the yawning deep <eol> nought dreading in the green sea 's caves to sleep <eol> for not for me shall wife or children mourn <eol> and the wild winds will ring my funeral knell <eol> sweetly as solemn peal of pious passing bell <eol>
