kindness gave solitude the lovely light <eol> she loved , and made less terrible black midnight <eol> even as a bird its unlearned music pours <eol> though windows all be blind and shut the doors <eol> and sings on still though no faint sound be heard <eol> but wind and leaves and another lonely bird <eol> so poured she untaught kindness all around <eol> and in that human music comfort found <eol> music her own and music heard from others <eol> prime music of all lovers , children , mothers <eol> precarious music between all men sounding <eol> the horror of silent and dark powers confounding <eol> singing that music she could bravely live <eol> hearing it , find less sorrow to forgive <eol>
