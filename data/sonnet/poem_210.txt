my spotless love hovers with purest wings <eol> about the temple of the proudest frame <eol> where blaze those lights , fairest of earthly things <eol> which clear our clouded world with brightest flame <eol> m'ambitious thoughts , confin Ã¨ d in her face <eol> affect no honour but what she can give <eol> my hopes do rest in limits of her grace <eol> i weigh no comfort unless she relieve <eol> for she that can my heart imparadise <eol> holds in her fairest hand what dearest is <eol> my fortune 's wheel 's the circle of her eyes <eol> whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss <eol> all my life 's sweet consists in her alone <eol> so much i love the most unloving one <eol>
