avenge , o lord , thy slaughtered saints , whose bones <eol> lie scattered on the alpine mountains cold <eol> even them who kept thy truth so pure of old <eol> when all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones <eol> forget not : in thy book record their groans <eol> who were thy sheep , and in their ancient fold <eol> slain by the bloody piedmontese that rolled <eol> mother with infant down the rocks . their moans <eol> the vales redoubled to the hills , and they <eol> to heaven . their martyred blood and ashes sow <eol> o'er all the italian fields , where still doth sway <eol> the triple tyrant ; that from these may grow <eol> a hundredfold , who , having learnt thy way <eol> early may fly the babylonian woe <eol>
