upon a cloud among the stars we stood <eol> the angel raised his hand and looked and said <eol> “ which world , of all yon starry myriad <eol> shall we make wing to ? ” the still solitude <eol> became a harp whereon his voice and mood <eol> made spheral music round his haloed head <eol> i spake — for then i had not long been dead <eol> “ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood <eol> a moment on these orbs ere i decide <eol> what is yon lower star that beauteous shines <eol> and with soft splendour now incarnadines <eol> our wings ? — there would i go and there abide <eol> then he as one who some child 's thought divines <eol> “ that is the world where yesternight you died <eol>
