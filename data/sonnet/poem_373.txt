if , when we meet , i 'm cropped in awkward style <eol> by some uneven barber , then you smile <eol> you smile , if , as it haps , my gown 's askew <eol> if my shirt 's ragged while my tunic 's new <eol> how , if my mind 's inconsequent , rejects <eol> what late it longed for , what it loathed affects <eol> shifts every moment , with itself at strife <eol> and makes a chaos of an ordered life <eol> builds castles up , then pulls them to the ground <eol> keeps changing round for square and square for round <eol> you smile not ; â€˜ tis an every day affair <eol> i need no doctor 's , no , nor keeper 's care <eol> yet you 're my patron , and would blush to fail <eol> in taking notice of an ill pared nail <eol>
