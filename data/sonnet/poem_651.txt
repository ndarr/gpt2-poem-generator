to know thee is all wisdom , and old age <eol> is but to know thee : dimly we behold thee <eol> athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee <eol> we beat upon our aching hearts with rage <eol> we cry for thee : we deem the world thy tomb <eol> as dwellers in lone planets look upon <eol> the mighty disk of their majestic sun <eol> hallowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom <eol> making their day dim , so we gaze on thee <eol> come , thou of many crowns , white rob è d love <eol> oh ! rend the veil in twain : all men adore thee <eol> heaven crieth after thee ; earth waileth for thee <eol> breathe on thy wing è d throne , and it shall move <eol> in music and in light o'er land and sea <eol>
