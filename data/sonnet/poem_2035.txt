if faithful souls be alike glorified <eol> as angels , then my father 's soul doth see <eol> and adds this even to full felicity <eol> that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride <eol> but if our minds to these souls be descried <eol> by circumstances and by signs that be <eol> apparent in us not immediately <eol> how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried <eol> they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn <eol> and style blasphemous conjurors to call <eol> on jesus â€™ name , and pharisaical <eol> dissemblers feign devotion . then turn <eol> o pensive soul ! to god , for he knows best <eol> thy grief , for he put it into my breast <eol>
