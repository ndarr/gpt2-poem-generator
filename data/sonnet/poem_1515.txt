if thou survive my well contented day <eol> when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover <eol> and shalt by fortune once more re survey <eol> these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover <eol> compare them with the bett'ring of the time <eol> and though they be outstripped by every pen <eol> reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme <eol> exceeded by the height of happier men <eol> o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought <eol> â€˜ had my friend 's muse grown with this growing age <eol> a dearer birth than this his love had brought <eol> to march in ranks of better equipage <eol> but since he died and poets better prove <eol> theirs for their style i 'll read , his for his love <eol>
