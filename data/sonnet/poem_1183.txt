stand , thou great bulwark of man 's liberty <eol> thou rock of shelter , rising from the wave <eol> sole refuge to the overwearied brave <eol> who planned , arose , and battled to be free <eol> fell , undeterred , then sadly turned to thee <eol> saved the free spirit from their country 's grave <eol> to rise again , and animate the slave <eol> when god shall ripen all things . britons , ye <eol> who guard the sacred outpost , not in vain <eol> hold your proud peril ! freemen undefiled <eol> keep watch and ward ! let battlements be piled <eol> around your cliffs ; fleets marshalled , till the main <eol> sink under them ; and if your courage wane <eol> through force or fraud , look westward to your child <eol>
