brown hills long parched , long lifting to the blue <eol> of summer 's brilliant sky but russet hue <eol> of sere grass shivering in the trade wind 's sweep <eol> soon , with light footfalls , from their tranced sleep <eol> the first rains bid the poppies rise anew <eol> and trills the lark exultant summons , too <eol> how swift at fancy 's beck those gay crowds leap <eol> to glowing life ! the eager green leaves creep <eol> for welcome first ; then hooded buds , pale gold <eol> each tender shower and sun kiss help unfold <eol> till smiling hosts crowd all the fields , and still <eol> a yellow sea of poppies breasts each hill <eol> and breaks in joyous floods as children hold <eol> glad hands the lavish cups as gladly fill <eol>
