when she comes home again ! a thousand ways <eol> i fashion , to myself , the tenderness <eol> of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes <eol> and touch her , as when first in the old days <eol> i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise <eol> mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress <eol> then silence : and the perfume of her dress <eol> the room will sway a little , and a haze <eol> cloy eyesight — soulsight , even — for a space <eol> and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat <eol> to know that i so ill deserve the place <eol> her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note <eol> i stay with kisses , ere the tearful face <eol> again is hidden in the old embrace <eol>
