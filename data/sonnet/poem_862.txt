a path , old tree , goes by thee crooking on <eol> and through this little gate that claps and bangs <eol> against thy rifted trunk , what steps hath gone <eol> though but a lonely way , yet mystery hangs <eol> oer crowds of pastoral scenes recordless here <eol> the boy might climb the nest in thy young boughs <eol> that 's slept half an eternity ; in fear <eol> the herdsman may have left his startled cows <eol> for shelter when heaven 's thunder voice was near <eol> here too the woodman on his wallet laid <eol> for pillow may have slept an hour away <eol> and poet pastoral , lover of the shade <eol> here sat and mused half some long summer day <eol> while some old shepherd listened to the lay <eol>
