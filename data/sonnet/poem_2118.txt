were't not for you , here should my pen have rest <eol> and take a long leave of sweet poesy <eol> britannia 's swains , and rivers far by west <eol> should hear no more mine oaten melody <eol> yet shall the song i sung of them awhile <eol> unperfect lie , and make no further known <eol> the happy loves of this our pleasant isle <eol> till i have left some record of mine own <eol> you are the subject now , and , writing you <eol> i well may versify , not poetize <eol> here needs no fiction : for the graces true <eol> and virtues clip not with base flatteries <eol> here could i write what you deserve of praise <eol> others might wear , but i should win the bays <eol>
