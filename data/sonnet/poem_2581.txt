straight from the sun 's grave in the deep clear west <eol> a sweet strong wind blows , glad of life : and i <eol> under the soft keen stardawn whence the sky <eol> takes life renewed , and all night 's godlike breast <eol> palpitates , gradually revealed at rest <eol> by growth and change of ardours felt on high <eol> make onward , till the last flame fall and die <eol> and all the world by night 's broad hand lie blest <eol> haply , meseems , as from that edge of death <eol> whereon the day lies dark , a brightening breath <eol> blows more of benediction than the morn <eol> so from the graves whereon grief gazing saith <eol> that half our heart of life there lies forlorn <eol> may light or breath at least of hope be born <eol>
