stranger than any book i 've ever read <eol> here on the reeking battlefield i lie <eol> under the stars , propped up with smeary dead <eol> like too , if no one takes me in , to die <eol> hit on the arms , legs , liver , lungs and gall <eol> damn glad there 's nothing more of me to hit <eol> but calm , and feeling never pain at all <eol> and full of wonder at the turn of it <eol> for of the dead around me three are mine <eol> three foemen vanquished in the whirl of fight <eol> so if i die i have no right to whine <eol> i feel i 've done my little bit all right <eol> i do n't know how â€” but there the beggars are <eol> as dead as herrings pickled in a jar <eol>
