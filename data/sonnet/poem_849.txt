why thus unjustly , say , my cruel fate <eol> dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart <eol> the one to live exiled from that sweet smart <eol> where th â€™ other pines , imprisoned without date <eol> my luckless eyes must never more debate <eol> of those bright beams that eased my love apart <eol> and yet my heart , bound to them with love 's dart <eol> must there dwell ever to bemoan my state <eol> o had mine eyes been suffered there to rest <eol> often they had my heart 's unquiet eased <eol> or had my heart with banishment been blest <eol> mine eye with beauty never had been pleased <eol> but since these cross effects hath fortune wrought <eol> dwell , heart , with her ; eyes , view her in my thought <eol>
