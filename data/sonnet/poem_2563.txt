as when it happ'neth that some lovely town <eol> unto a barbarous besieger falls <eol> who both by sword and flame himself installs <eol> and , shameless , it in tears and blood doth drown <eol> her beauty spoil 'd , her citizens made thralls <eol> his spite yet cannot so her all throw down <eol> but that some statue , pillar of renown <eol> yet lurks unmaim 'd within her weeping walls <eol> so , after all the spoil , disgrace , and wreck <eol> that time , the world , and death , could bring combined <eol> amidst that mass of ruins they did make <eol> safe and all scarless yet remains my mind <eol> from this so high transcending rapture springs <eol> that i , all else defaced , not envy kings <eol>
