dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep <eol> a restless presence stirring with the light <eol> the cry of waters where the snow was white <eol> a violet 's whisper where dead leaves lay deep <eol> the dim wood 's music makes a sudden leap <eol> broken notes , blending in a wild delight <eol> and lo ! the whole world changes in our sight <eol> promise is ended â€” we must turn and reap <eol> fulfilment , for the spring with all her wealth <eol> is with us , and compels us to her will <eol> yet if the sun dawn we should shun by stealth <eol> yearning for shadows and the darkened hours <eol> sweet lord , be pitiful , remembering still <eol> one lieth low beneath the budding flowers <eol>
