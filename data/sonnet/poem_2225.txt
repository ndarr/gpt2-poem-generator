long while i sought to what i might compare <eol> those powrefull eies which lighten my dark spright <eol> yet find i nought on earth , to which i dare <eol> resemble th'ymage of their goodly light <eol> not to the sun , for they doo shine by night <eol> nor to the moone , for they are changed never <eol> nor to the starres , for they have purer sight <eol> nor to the fire , for they consume not ever <eol> nor to the lightning , for they still persever <eol> nor to the diamond , for they are more tender <eol> nor unto cristall , for nought may them sever <eol> nor unto glasse , such basenesse mought offend her <eol> then to the maker selfe they likest be <eol> whose light doth lighten all that here we see <eol>
