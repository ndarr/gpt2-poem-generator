as some poor starveling at a palace gate <eol> sees curtained gleams from banquet litten halls <eol> hears song out ringing from the festal walls <eol> scents viands that shall princely palates sate <eol> yet in the outer gloom may only wait <eol> crouched in the cold , thrice thankful for some least <eol> mean morsel flung him from the plenteous feast <eol> poor bondman to the ball and chain of fate <eol> so , lonely at love 's outer gate i stand <eol> and glimpse the brightness and the bliss within <eol> where love lit smiles transmute the dark to day <eol> i wait without — i may not enter in <eol> long , wistfully , i gaze — then void of hand <eol> and starved of spirit , sadly turn away <eol>
