what can i give thee back , o liberal <eol> and princely giver , who hast brought the gold <eol> and purple of thine heart , unstained , untold <eol> and laid them on the outside of the wall <eol> for such as i to take or leave withal <eol> in unexpected largesse ? am i cold <eol> ungrateful , that for these most manifold <eol> high gifts , i render nothing back at all <eol> not so ; not cold ,â€” but very poor instead <eol> ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run <eol> the colours from my life , and left so dead <eol> and pale a stuff , it were not fitly done <eol> to give the same as pillow to thy head <eol> go farther ! let it serve to trample on <eol>
