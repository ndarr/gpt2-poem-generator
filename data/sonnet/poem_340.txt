long hath my sufferance laboured to enforce <eol> one pearl of pity from her pretty eyes <eol> whilst i with restless rivers of remorse <eol> have bathed the banks where my fair phillis lies <eol> the moaning lines which weeping i have written <eol> and writing read unto my ruthful sheep <eol> and reading sent with tears that never fitten <eol> to my love 's queen , that hath my heart in keep <eol> have made my lambkins lay them down and sigh <eol> but phillis sits , and reads , and calls them trifles <eol> oh heavens , why climb not happy lines so high <eol> to rent that ruthless heart that all hearts rifles <eol> none writes with truer faith , or greater love <eol> yet out , alas ! i have no power to move <eol>
