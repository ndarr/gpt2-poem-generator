i must not think of thee ; and , tired yet strong <eol> i shun the thought that lurks in all delight <eol> the thought of thee â€” and in the blue heaven 's height <eol> and in the dearest passage of a song <eol> oh , just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng <eol> this breast the thought of thee waits , hidden yet bright <eol> but it must never , never come in sight <eol> i must stop short of thee the whole day long <eol> but when sleep comes to close each difficult day <eol> when night gives pause to the long watch i keep <eol> and all my bonds i needs must loose apart <eol> must doff my will as raiment laid away <eol> with the first dream that comes with the first sleep <eol> i run , i run , i am gathered to thy heart <eol>
