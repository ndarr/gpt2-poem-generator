how can i think , or edge my thoughts to action <eol> when the miserly press of each day ’ s need <eol> aches to a narrowness of spilled distraction <eol> my soul appalled at the world ’ s work ’ s time greed <eol> how can i pause my thoughts upon the task <eol> my soul was born to think that it must do <eol> when every moment has a thought to ask <eol> to fit the immediate craving of its cue <eol> the coin i ’ d heap for marrying my muse <eol> and build our home i ’ th ’ greater time to be <eol> becomes dissolved by needs of each day ’ s use <eol> and i feel beggared of infinity <eol> like a true christian sinner , each day flesh driven <eol> by his own act to forfeit his wished heaven <eol>
