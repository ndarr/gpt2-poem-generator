lift up thy light on us and on thine own <eol> o soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod <eol> to scourge off priests , a sword to pierce their god <eol> a staff for man 's free thought to walk alone <eol> a lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne <eol> on ways untrodden where his fathers trod <eol> ere earth 's heart withered at a high priest 's nod <eol> and all men 's mouths that made not prayer made moan <eol> from bonds and torments and the ravening flame <eol> surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet <eol> lucretius , where such only spirits meet <eol> and walk with him apart till shelley came <eol> to make the heaven of heavens more heavenly sweet <eol> and mix with yours a third incorporate name <eol>
