a light wind , from the open casement , fanned <eol> my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand <eol> sat looking out upon the twilight scene <eol> in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes <eol> like two lost stars that wandered from the skies <eol> some night adown the meteor 's shining track <eol> and always had been grieving to go back <eol> now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome <eol> and seemed to recognise and long for home <eol> her sweet voice broke the silence : â€œ wish , maurine <eol> before you speak ! you know the moon is new <eol> and anything you wish for will come true <eol> before it wanes . i do believe the sign <eol> now tell me your wish , and i 'll tell you mine <eol>
