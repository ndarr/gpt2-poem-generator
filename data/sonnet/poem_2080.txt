at last , beloved nature ! i have met <eol> thee face to face upon thy breezy hills <eol> and boldly , where thy inmost bowers are set <eol> gazed on thee naked in thy mountain rills <eol> when first i felt thy breath upon my brow <eol> tears of strange ecstasy gushed out like rain <eol> and with a longing , passionate as vain <eol> i strove to clasp thee . but , i know not how <eol> always before me didst thou seem to glide <eol> and often from one sunny mountain side <eol> upon the next bright peak i saw thee kneel <eol> and heard thy voice upon the billowy blast <eol> but , climbing , only reached that shrine to feel <eol> the shadow of a presence which had passed <eol>
