grant , fairest kind , a kiss unto thy friend <eol> a blush replied , and yet a kiss i had <eol> it is not heaven that can such nectar send <eol> whereat my senses all amazed were glad <eol> this done , she fled as one that was affrayed <eol> and i desired to kiss by kissing more <eol> my love she frowned , and i my kissing stayed <eol> yet wished to kiss her as i did before <eol> then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp <eol> loath to depart till both together die <eol> so fold me , sweet , until my latest gasp <eol> that in thy arms to death i kissed may lie <eol> thus whilst i live for kisses i must call <eol> still kiss me , sweet , or kiss me not at all <eol>
