when thou shalt search thy glass nor find the flower <eol> that there so long smiled gay , unwithering <eol> and from sad vantage of a forlorn hour <eol> that fore nor aft unmasks one hint of spring <eol> thou mourn'st the barrenness of beauty spent <eol> with no reserv Ã¨ d treasure for the day <eol> when all that youth and sunny fortune lent <eol> no more should light adoring eyes to thee <eol> and fear'st thyself a cold , by the last storm <eol> beat to thine inn , a still , uncarping guest <eol> thy once bright eye a pilot to the worm <eol> making his dungeon way to his new feast <eol> drop not a tear then for thy beauty fled <eol> but for the wounds it healed not bow thy head <eol>
