then spake the lad : â€œ and once i saw a host <eol> of men pass by the borders of the wood <eol> a glitter in the sun , and riding fast <eol> on splendid creatures , prancing as they went <eol> oh , i would fain have been like these fair men <eol> but , laughing gaily , on they galloped fast <eol> and i ran after them to be like them <eol> and join the glittering host and see the world <eol> but though i ran , they faded from my sight <eol> yet have i followed , over hill and dale <eol> day after day i follow on their track <eol> and here i am as now you see me here <eol> my bow has done me service on the way <eol> against wild beasts and savage seeming men <eol>
