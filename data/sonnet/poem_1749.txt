death ! be not proud , though some have called thee <eol> mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so <eol> for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow <eol> die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me <eol> from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be <eol> much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow <eol> and soonest our best men with thee do go <eol> rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery <eol> thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men <eol> and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell <eol> and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well <eol> and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then <eol> one short sleep past we wake eternally <eol> and death shall be no more ; death , thou shalt die <eol>
