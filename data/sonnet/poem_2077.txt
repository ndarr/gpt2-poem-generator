when most i wink then do mine eyes best see <eol> for all the day they view things unrespected <eol> but when i sleep , in dreams they look on thee <eol> and darkly bright , are bright in dark directed <eol> then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright <eol> how would thy shadow 's form , form happy show <eol> to the clear day with thy much clearer light <eol> when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so <eol> how would ( i say ) mine eyes be blessed made <eol> by looking on thee in the living day <eol> when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade <eol> through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay <eol> all days are nights to see till i see thee <eol> and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me <eol>
