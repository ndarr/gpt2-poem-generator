o great and wise , clear souled and high of heart <eol> one the last flower of catholic love , that grows <eol> amid bare thorns their only thornless rose <eol> from the fierce juggling of the priests ’ loud mart <eol> yet alien , yet unspotted and apart <eol> from the blind hard foul rout whose shameless shows <eol> mock the sweet heaven whose secret no man knows <eol> with prayers and curses and the soothsayer 's art <eol> one like a storm god of the northern foam <eol> strong , wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea <eol> and thunders back its thunder , rhyme for rhyme <eol> answering , as though to outroar the tides of time <eol> and bid the world 's wave back — what song should be <eol> theirs that with praise would bring and sing you home <eol>
