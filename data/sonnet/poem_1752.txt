i learnt to write to you in happier days <eol> and every letter was a piece i chipped <eol> from off my heart , a fragment newly clipped <eol> from the mosaic of life ; its blues and grays <eol> its throbbing reds , i gave to earn your praise <eol> to make a pavement for your feet i stripped <eol> my soul for you to walk upon , and slipped <eol> beneath your steps to soften all your ways <eol> but now my letters are like blossoms pale <eol> we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears <eol> i ask no recompense , i shall not fail <eol> although you do not heed ; the long , sad years <eol> still pass , and still i scatter flowers frail <eol> and whisper words of love which no one hears <eol>
