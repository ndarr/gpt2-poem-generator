oh ! my black soul ! now thou art summoned <eol> by sickness , death 's herald and champion <eol> thou â€˜ rt like a pilgrim which abroad hath done <eol> treason , and durst not turn to whence he is fled <eol> or like a thief , which , till death 's doom be read <eol> wisheth himself delivered from prison <eol> but damn 'd , and haul 'd to execution <eol> wisheth that still he might be imprisoned <eol> yet grace , if thou repent , thou canst not lack <eol> but who shall give thee that grace to begin <eol> oh ! make thyself with holy mourning black <eol> and red with blushing , as thou art with sin <eol> or wash thee in christ 's blood , which hath this might <eol> that , being red , it dyes red souls to white <eol>
