slowly the hour hand of the clock moves round <eol> so slowly that no human eye hath power <eol> to see it move ! slowly in shine or shower <eol> the painted ship above it , homeward bound <eol> sails , but seems motionless , as if aground <eol> yet both arrive at last ; and in his tower <eol> the slumberous watchman wakes and strikes the hour <eol> a mellow , measured , melancholy sound <eol> midnight ! the outpost of advancing day <eol> the frontier town and citadel of night <eol> the watershed of time , from which the streams <eol> of yesterday and to morrow take their way <eol> one to the land of promise and of light <eol> one to the land of darkness and of dreams <eol>
