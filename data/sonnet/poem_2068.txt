thousands of thousands of hushed years ago <eol> out on the edge of chaos , all alone <eol> i stood on peaks of vapor , high upthrown <eol> above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow <eol> nor any motion won of winds that blow <eol> nor any sound of watery wail or moan <eol> nor lisp of wave , nor wandering undertone <eol> of any tide lost in the night below <eol> so still it was , i mind me , as i laid <eol> my thirsty ear against mine own faint sigh <eol> to drink of that , i sipped it , half afraid <eol> â€˜ twas but the ghost of a dead voice spilled by <eol> the one starved star that tottered through the shade <eol> and came tiptoeing toward me down the sky <eol>
