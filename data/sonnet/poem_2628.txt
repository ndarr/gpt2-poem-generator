a little garden on a bleak hillside <eol> where deep the heavy , dazzling mountain snow <eol> lies far into the spring . the sun 's pale glow <eol> is scarcely able to melt patches wide <eol> about the single rose bush . all denied <eol> of nature 's tender ministries . but no <eol> for wonder working faith has made it blow <eol> with flowers many hued and starry eyed <eol> here sleeps the sun long , idle summer hours <eol> here butterflies and bees fare far to rove <eol> amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers <eol> here four o'clocks , to the passionate night above <eol> fling whiffs of perfume , like pale incense showers <eol> a little garden , loved with a great love <eol>
