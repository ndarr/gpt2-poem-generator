wait for the morning ! ah ! we wait indeed <eol> for daylight , we who toss about through stress <eol> of vacant armed desires and emptiness <eol> of all the warm , warm touches that we need <eol> and the warm kisses upon which we feed <eol> our famished lips in fancy ! may god bless <eol> the starved lips of us with but one caress <eol> warm as the yearning blood our poor hearts bleed <eol> a wild prayer â€”! bite thy pillow , praying so <eol> toss this side , and whirl that , and moan for dawn <eol> let the clock 's seconds dribble out their woe <eol> and time be drained of sorrow ! long ago <eol> we heard the crowing cock , with answer drawn <eol> as hoarsely sad at throat as sobs ... pray on <eol>
