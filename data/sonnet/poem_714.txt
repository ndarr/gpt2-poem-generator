homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose <eol> while vet they struggled with their banded foes <eol> as in the west thy century 's sun descends <eol> one parting gleam its dying radiance lends <eol> darker and deeper though the shadows fall <eol> from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall <eol> though pope and pagan re array their hosts <eol> and her new armor youthful science boasts <eol> truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine <eol> shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine <eol> no past shall chain her with its rusted vow <eol> no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow <eol> but faith shall smile to find her sister free <eol> and nobler manhood draw its life from thee <eol>
