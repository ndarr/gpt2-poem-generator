one spring brought me my wedding day <eol> brought me my bright eyed jeanne amray <eol> brought that night to our cabin door <eol> my old , lost comrade , nell latore <eol> her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red <eol> her full breast heaved as she darkly said <eol> â€œ the coyote hides from the wind and rain <eol> the wild horse flies from the hurricane <eol> but who can flee from the half breed 's hate <eol> that rises soon and that watches late <eol> then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar <eol> but i thought that wench was our evil star <eol> be sure , when a woman 's heart gets hard <eol> it works up war like a navy yard <eol>
