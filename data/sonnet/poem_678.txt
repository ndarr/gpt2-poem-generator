make me thy lyre , ev'n as the forest is <eol> what if my leaves are falling like its own <eol> the tumult of thy mighty harmonies <eol> will take from both a deep autumnal tone <eol> sweet though in sadness . be thou , spirit fierce <eol> my spirit ! be thou me , impetuous one <eol> drive my dead thoughts over the universe <eol> like wither 'd leaves to quicken a new birth <eol> and , by the incantation of this verse <eol> scatter , as from an unextinguish 'd hearth <eol> ashes and sparks , my words among mankind <eol> be through my lips to unawaken 'd earth <eol> the trumpet of a prophecy ! o , wind <eol> if winter comes , can spring be far behind <eol>
