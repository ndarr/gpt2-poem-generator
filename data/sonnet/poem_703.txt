umbrageous woods , green dells , and mountains high <eol> and bright cascades , and wide cerulean seas <eol> slumbering , or snow wreathed by the freshening breeze <eol> and isles like motionless clouds upon the sky <eol> in silent summer noons , late charmed mine eye <eol> until my soul was stirred like wind touched trees <eol> and passionate love and speechless ecstasies <eol> up raised the thoughts in spiritual depths that lie <eol> fair scenes , ye haunt me still ! yet i behold <eol> this sultry city on the level shore <eol> not all unmoved ; for here our fathers bold <eol> won proud historic names in days of yore <eol> and here are generous hearts that ne'er grow cold <eol> and many a friendly hand and open door <eol>
