thus graced , thus glorified , shall shakspeare crave <eol> the sculptor 's skill , the pageant of the grave <eol> he needs it not — but gratitude demands <eol> this votive offering at his country 's hands <eol> haply , e'er now , from blissful bowers on high <eol> from some parnassus of the empyreal sky <eol> pleased , o'er this dome the gentle spirit bends <eol> accepts the gift , and hails us as his friends <eol> yet smiles , perchance , to think when envious time <eol> o'er bust and urn shall bid his ivies climb <eol> when palaces and pyramids shall fall <eol> his page shall triumph — still surviving all <eol> ‘ till earth itself , “ like breath upon the wind <eol> shall melt away , “ nor leave a rack behind <eol>
