are there two things , of all which men possess <eol> that are so like each other and so near <eol> as mutual love seems like to happiness <eol> dear asra , woman beyond utterance dear <eol> this love which ever welling at my heart <eol> now in its living fount doth heave and fall <eol> now overflowing pours thro â€™ every part <eol> of all my frame , and fills and changes all <eol> like vernal waters springing up through snow <eol> this love that seeming great beyond the power <eol> of growth , yet seemeth ever more to grow <eol> could i transmute the whole to one rich dower <eol> of happy life , and give it all to thee <eol> thy lot , methinks , were heaven , thy age , eternity <eol>
