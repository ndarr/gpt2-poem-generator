here morning in the ploughman 's songs is met <eol> ere yet one footstep shows in all the sky <eol> and twilight in the east , a doubt as yet <eol> shows not her sleeve of grey to know her bye <eol> woke early , i arose and thought that first <eol> in winter time of all the world was i <eol> the old owls might have hallooed if they durst <eol> but joy just then was up and whistled bye <eol> a merry tune which i had known full long <eol> but could not to my memory wake it back <eol> until the ploughman changed it to the song <eol> o happiness , how simple is thy track <eol> â€” tinged like the willow shoots , the east 's young brow <eol> glows red and finds thee singing at the plough <eol>
