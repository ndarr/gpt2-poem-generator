the good shah akbar ( peace be his alway <eol> came forth from the divan at close of day <eol> bowed with the burden of his many cares <eol> worn with the hearing of unnumbered prayers <eol> wild cries for justice , the importunate <eol> appeals of greed and jealousy and hate <eol> and all the strife of sect and creed and rite <eol> santon and gouroo waging holy fight <eol> for the wise monarch , claiming not to be <eol> allah 's avenger , left his people free <eol> with a faint hope , his book scarce justified <eol> that all the paths of faith , though severed wide <eol> o'er which the feet of prayerful reverence passed <eol> met at the gate of paradise at last <eol>
