â€œ curse thee , life , i will live with thee no more <eol> thou hast mocked me , starved me , beat my body sore <eol> and all for a pledge that was not pledged by me <eol> i have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly <eol> that i might eat again , and met thy sneers <eol> with deprecations , and thy blows with tears <eol> aye , from thy glutted lash , glad , crawled away <eol> as if spent passion were a holiday <eol> and now i go . nor threat , nor easy vow <eol> of tardy kindness can avail thee now <eol> with me , whence fear and faith alike are flown <eol> lonely i came , and i depart alone <eol> and know not where nor unto whom i go <eol> but that thou canst not follow me i know <eol>
