when the dread trumpet sounds , the slumbering dust <eol> not unattentive to the call , shall wake <eol> and every joint possess its proper place <eol> with a new elegance of form unknown <eol> to its first state . nor shall the conscious soul <eol> mistake its partner , but , amidst the crowd <eol> singling its other half , into its arms <eol> shall rush with all the impatience of a man <eol> that 's new come home , who having long been absent <eol> with haste runs over every different room <eol> in pain to see the whole . thrice happy meeting <eol> nor time nor death shall part them ever more <eol> â€˜ tis but a night , a long and moonless night <eol> we make the grave our bed , and then are gone <eol>
