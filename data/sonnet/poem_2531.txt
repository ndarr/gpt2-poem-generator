i feel the well known breeze , and the sweet hill <eol> again appears , where rose that beauteous light <eol> which , while heaven willed it , met my eyes , then bright <eol> with gladness , but now dimmed with many an ill <eol> vain hopes ! weak thoughts ! now , turbid is the rill <eol> the flowers have drooped ; and she hath ta'en her flight <eol> from the cold nest , which once , in proud delight <eol> living and dying , i had hoped to fill <eol> i hoped , in these retreats , and in the blaze <eol> of her fair eyes , which have consumed my heart <eol> to taste the sweet reward of troubled days <eol> thou , whom i serve , how hard and proud thou art <eol> erewhile , thy flame consumed me ; now , i mourn <eol> over the ashes which have ceased to burn <eol>
