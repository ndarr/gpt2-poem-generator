white , glittering sunlight fills the market square <eol> spotted and sprigged with shadows . double rows <eol> of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows <eol> of globed and golden fruit , the morning air <eol> smells sweet with ripeness , on the pavement there <eol> a wicker basket gapes and overflows <eol> spilling out cool , blue plums . the market glows <eol> and flaunts , and clatters in its busy care <eol> a stately minster at the northern side <eol> lifts its twin spires to the distant sky <eol> pinnacled , carved and buttressed ; through the wide <eol> arched doorway peals an organ , suddenly <eol> crashing , triumphant in its pregnant tide <eol> quenching the square in vibrant harmony <eol>
