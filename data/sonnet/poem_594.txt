two voices are there ; one is of the sea <eol> one of the mountains ; each a mighty voice <eol> in both from age to age thou didst rejoice <eol> they were thy chosen music , liberty <eol> there came a tyrant , and with holy glee <eol> thou fought'st against him ; but hast vainly striven <eol> thou from thy alpine holds at length art driven <eol> where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee <eol> of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft <eol> then cleave , o cleave to that which still is left <eol> for , high soul 'd maid , what sorrow would it be <eol> that mountain floods should thunder as before <eol> and ocean bellow from his rocky shore <eol> and neither awful voice be heard by thee <eol>
