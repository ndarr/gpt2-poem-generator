i reached the alps : the soul within me burned <eol> italia , my italia , at thy name <eol> and when from out the mountain 's heart i came <eol> and saw the land for which my life had yearned <eol> i laughed as one who some great prize had earned <eol> and musing on the marvel of thy fame <eol> i watched the day , till marked with wounds of flame <eol> the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned <eol> the pine trees waved as waves a woman 's hair <eol> and in the orchards every twining spray <eol> was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam <eol> but when i knew that far away at rome <eol> in evil bonds a second peter lay <eol> i wept to see the land so very fair <eol>
