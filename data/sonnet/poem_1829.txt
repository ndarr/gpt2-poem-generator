thus am i mine own prison . everything <eol> around me free and sunny and at ease <eol> or if in shadow , in a shade of trees <eol> which the sun kisses , where the gay birds sing <eol> and where all winds make various murmuring <eol> where bees are found , with honey for the bees <eol> where sounds are music , and where silences <eol> are music of an unlike fashioning <eol> then gaze i at the merrymaking crew <eol> and smile a moment and a moment sigh <eol> thinking : why can i not rejoice with you <eol> but soon i put the foolish fancy by <eol> i am not what i have nor what i do <eol> but what i was i am , i am even i <eol>
