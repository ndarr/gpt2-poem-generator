ah , god ! the world needs many hours to make <eol> nor hast thou ceased the making of it yet <eol> but wilt be working on when death hath set <eol> a new mound in some churchyard for my sake <eol> on flow the centuries without a break <eol> uprise the mountains , ages without let <eol> the mosses suck the rock 's breast , rarely wet <eol> years more than past , the young earth yet will take <eol> but in the dumbness of the rolling time <eol> no veil of silence will encompass me <eol> thou wilt not once forget , and let me be <eol> i easier think that thou , as i my rhyme <eol> wouldst rise , and with a tenderness sublime <eol> unfold a world , that i , thy child , might see <eol>
