o than the fairest day , thrice fairer night <eol> night to blest days in which a sun doth rise <eol> of which that golden age which clears the skies <eol> is but a sparkling ray , a shadow light <eol> and blessed ye , in silly pastors ’ sight <eol> mild creatures , in whose warm crib now lies <eol> that heaven sent youngling , holy maid born wight <eol> midst , end , beginning of our prophecies <eol> blest cottage that hath flowers in winter spread <eol> though withered — blessed grass that hath the grace <eol> to deck and be a carpet to that place <eol> thus sang , unto the sounds , of oaten reed <eol> before the babe , the shepherds bowed on knees <eol> and springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees <eol>
