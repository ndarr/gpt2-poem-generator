i wish i could remember that first day <eol> first hour , first moment of your meeting me <eol> if bright or dim the season , it might be <eol> summer or winter for aught i can say <eol> so unrecorded did it slip away <eol> so blind was i to see and to foresee <eol> so dull to mark the budding of my tree <eol> that would not blossom yet for many a may <eol> if only i could recollect it , such <eol> a day of days ! i let it come and go <eol> as traceless as a thaw of bygone snow <eol> it seemed to mean so little , meant so much <eol> if only now i could recall that touch <eol> first touch of hand in hand â€” did one but know <eol>
