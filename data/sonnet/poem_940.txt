as an unperfect actor on the stage <eol> who with his fear is put beside his part <eol> or some fierce thing replete with too much rage <eol> whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart <eol> so i for fear of trust , forget to say <eol> the perfect ceremony of love 's rite <eol> and in mine own love 's strength seem to decay <eol> o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love 's might <eol> o let my looks be then the eloquence <eol> and dumb presagers of my speaking breast <eol> who plead for love , and look for recompense <eol> more than that tongue that more hath more expressed <eol> o learn to read what silent love hath writ <eol> to hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit <eol>
