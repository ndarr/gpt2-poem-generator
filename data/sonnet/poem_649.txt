not in our dreams , not even in our dreams <eol> may we return to that sweet land of youth <eol> that home of hope , of innocence , and truth <eol> which as we farther roam but fairer seems <eol> in that dim shadowy world , where the soul strays <eol> when she has laid her mortal charge to rest <eol> we oft behold far future hours and days <eol> but ne'er live o'er the past , the happiest <eol> how oft will fancy 's wild imaginings <eol> bear us in sleep to times and worlds unseen <eol> but ah ! not e'en unfettered fancy 's wings <eol> can lead us back to aught that we have been <eol> or waft us to that smiling , sunny shore <eol> which e'en in slumber we may tread no more <eol>
