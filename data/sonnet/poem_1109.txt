maid with the poppies , must i let thee go <eol> alas , i may not ; thou art likewise dear <eol> i am but human , and thou hast a tear <eol> when she hath nought but splendour , and the glow <eol> of a wild energy that mocks the flow <eol> of the poor sympathies which keep us here <eol> lay past thy poppies , and come twice as near <eol> and i will teach thee , and thou too shalt grow <eol> and thou shalt walk with me in open day <eol> through the rough thoroughfares with quiet grace <eol> and the wild visaged maid shall lead the way <eol> timing her footsteps to a gentler pace <eol> as her great orbs turn ever on thy face <eol> drinking in draughts of loving help alway <eol>
