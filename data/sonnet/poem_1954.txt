as the chill 'd robin , bound to florida <eol> upon a morn of autumn , crosses flying <eol> the air track of a snipe most passing fair <eol> yet colder in her blood than she is fair <eol> and as that robin lingers on the wing <eol> and feels the snipe 's flight in the eddying air <eol> and loves her for her coldness not the less <eol> but fain would win her to that warmer sky <eol> where love lies waking with the fragrant stars <eol> lo i â€” a languisher for sunnier climes <eol> where fruit , leaf , blossom , on the trees forever <eol> image the tropic deathlessness of love <eol> have met , and long 'd to win thee , fairest lady <eol> to a more genial clime than cold broadway <eol>
