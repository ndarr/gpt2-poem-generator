dear fellow traveller ! here we are once more <eol> the cock that crows , the smoke that curls , that sound <eol> of bells , those boys that in yon meadow ground <eol> in white sleev 'd shirts are playing by the score <eol> and even this little river 's gentle roar <eol> all , all are english . oft have i look 'd round <eol> with joy in kent 's green vales ; but never found <eol> myself so satisfied in heart before <eol> europe is yet in bonds ; but let that pass <eol> thought for another moment . thou art free <eol> my country ! and â€˜ tis joy enough and pride <eol> for one hour 's perfect bliss , to tread the grass <eol> of england once again , and hear and see <eol> with such a dear companion at my side <eol>
