still , resignation was my dearest friend <eol> and reason pointed to a glorious end <eol> with anxious sighs , a parent 's hopes and pride <eol> i wish 'd to live — i trust i could have died <eol> but winter 's clouds pursu 'd their stormy way <eol> and march brought sunshine with the length'ning day <eol> and bade my heart arise , that morn and night <eol> now throbb 'd with irresistible delight <eol> delightful ‘ twas to leave disease behind <eol> and feel the renovation of the mind <eol> to lead abroad upborne on pleasure 's wing <eol> our children , midst the glories of the spring <eol> our fellow sufferers , our only wealth <eol> to gather daisies in the breeze of health <eol>
