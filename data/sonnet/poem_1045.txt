then spake king arthur to sir bedivere <eol> “ far other is this battle in the west <eol> whereto we move , than when we strove in youth <eol> and brake the petty kings , and fought with rome <eol> or thrust the heathen from the roman wall <eol> and shook him thro ’ the north . ill doom is mine <eol> to war against my people and my knights <eol> the king who fights his people fights himself <eol> and they my knights , who loved me once , the stroke <eol> that strikes them dead is as my death to me <eol> yet let us hence , and find or feel a way <eol> thro ’ this blind haze , which ever since i saw <eol> one lying in the dust at almesbury <eol> hath folded in the passes of the world <eol>
