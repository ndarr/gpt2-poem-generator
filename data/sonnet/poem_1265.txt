â€˜ t is you that are the music , not your song <eol> the song is but a door which , opening wide <eol> lets forth the pent up melody inside <eol> your spirit 's harmony , which clear and strong <eol> sings but of you . throughout your whole life long <eol> your songs , your thoughts , your doings , each divide <eol> this perfect beauty ; waves within a tide <eol> or single notes amid a glorious throng <eol> the song of earth has many different chords <eol> ocean has many moods and many tones <eol> yet always ocean . in the damp spring woods <eol> the painted trillium smiles , while crisp pine cones <eol> autumn alone can ripen . so is this <eol> one music with a thousand cadences <eol>
