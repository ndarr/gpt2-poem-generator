o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed <eol> of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair <eol> went first , but left its priceless coil of hair <eol> moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed <eol> through drip and blur of tears the tenderest <eol> and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there <eol> her very sister !... it is here ; but where <eol> is she , of all the world the first and best <eol> and yet how sweet the sweet earth after rain <eol> how sweet the sunlight on the garden wall <eol> across the roses — and how sweetly flows <eol> the limpid yodel of the brook again <eol> and yet — and yet how sweeter after all <eol> the smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose <eol>
