voltaire , our england 's lover , man divine <eol> beyond all gods that ever fear adored <eol> by right and might , by sceptre and by sword <eol> by godlike love of sunlike truth , made thine <eol> through godlike hate of falsehood 's marshlight shine <eol> and all the fume of creeds and deeds abhorred <eol> whose light was darkness , till the dawn star soared <eol> truth , reason , mercy , justice , keep thy shrine <eol> sacred in memory 's temple , seeing that none <eol> of all souls born to strive before the sun <eol> loved ever good or hated evil more <eol> the snake that felt thy heel upon her head <eol> night 's first born , writhes as though she were not dead <eol> but strikes not , stings not , slays not as before <eol>
