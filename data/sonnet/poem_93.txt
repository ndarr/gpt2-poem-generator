last night her form the hours of slumber bless 'd <eol> whose eyes illumin 'd all my youthful years <eol> spirit of dreams , at thy command appears <eol> each airy shape , that visiting our rest <eol> dismays , perplexes , or delights the breast <eol> my pensive heart this kind indulgence cheers <eol> bliss , in no waking moment now possess 'd <eol> bliss , ask 'd of thee with memory 's thrilling tears <eol> nightly i cry , how oft , alas ! in vain <eol> give , by thy powers , that airy shapes controul <eol> honora to my visions !â€” ah ! ordain <eol> her beauteous lip may wear the smile that stole <eol> in years long fled , the sting from every pain <eol> show her sweet face , ah show it to my soul <eol>
