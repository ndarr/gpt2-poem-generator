my song i do but hold for you in trust <eol> i ask you but to blossom from my dust <eol> when you have compassed all weak i began <eol> diviner poet , and ah ! diviner man <eol> the man at feud with the perduring child <eol> in you before song 's altar nobly reconciled <eol> from the wise heavens i half shall smile to see <eol> how little a world , which owned you , needed me <eol> if , while you keep the vigils of the night <eol> for your wild tears make darkness all too bright <eol> some lone orb through your lonely window peeps <eol> as it played lover over your sweet sleeps <eol> think it a golden crevice in the sky <eol> which i have pierced but to behold you by <eol>
