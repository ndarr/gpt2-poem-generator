england ! the time is come when thou should'st wean <eol> thy heart from its emasculating food <eol> the truth should now be better understood <eol> old things have been unsettled ; we have seen <eol> fair seed time , better harvest might have been <eol> but for thy trespasses ; and , at this day <eol> if for greece , egypt , india , africa <eol> aught good were destined , thou would'st step between <eol> england ! all nations in this charge agree <eol> but worse , more ignorant in love and hate <eol> far â€” far more abject , is thine enemy <eol> therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight <eol> of thy offences be a heavy weight <eol> oh grief that earth 's best hopes rest all with thee <eol>
