not sweeter to the storm tossed mariner <eol> is glimpse of home , where wife and children wait <eol> to welcome him with kisses at the gate <eol> than to the town worn man the breezy stir <eol> of mountain winds on rugged pathless heights <eol> his long pent soul drinks in the deep delights <eol> that nature hath in store . the sun kissed bay <eol> gleams thro â€™ the grand old gnarled gum tree boughs <eol> like burnished brass ; the strong winged bird of prey <eol> sweeps by , upon his lonely vengeful way <eol> while over all , like breath of holy vows <eol> the sweet airs blow , and the high vaulted sky <eol> looks down in pity this fair summer day <eol> on all poor earth born creatures doomed to die <eol>
