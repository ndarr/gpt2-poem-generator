to speak of him in language of our own <eol> is not for us too daringly to try <eol> but , saviour , we can read thy history <eol> upon the faces round thy humble throne <eol> and as the flower among the grass makes known <eol> what summer suns have warmed it from the sky <eol> as every human smile and human sigh <eol> is witness that we do not live alone <eol> so in that company â€” in those sweet tears <eol> the first born of a rugged melted heart <eol> in those gaunt chains for ever torn apart <eol> and in the words that weeping mother hears <eol> we read the story of two thousand years <eol> and know thee somewhat , saviour , as thou art <eol>
