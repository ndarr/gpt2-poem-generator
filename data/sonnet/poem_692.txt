my own beloved , who hast lifted me <eol> from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown <eol> and in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown <eol> a life breath , till the forehead hopefully <eol> shines out again , as all the angels see <eol> before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own <eol> who camest to me when the world was gone <eol> and i who looked for only god , found thee <eol> i find thee : i am safe , and strong , and glad <eol> as one who stands in dewless asphodel <eol> looks backward on the tedious time he had <eol> in the upper life ... so i , with bosom swell <eol> make witness here between the good and bad <eol> that love , as strong as death , retrieves as well <eol>
