i heard in my slumbers the ceaseless roar <eol> of the sparkling waves , as they met the shore <eol> till lulled by the surge of the moon lit deep <eol> by the heaving ocean i sank to sleep <eol> and a magic spell on my spirit was cast <eol> and forms that had perished in ages past <eol> were by fancy revealed to my wondering view <eol> as the veil of oblivion she backward drew <eol> and showed me a glorious vision , dressed <eol> in the rosy light of the glowing west <eol> such colours at parting the day god throws <eol> to gild his path , as rejoicing he goes <eol> like a victor red with the spoils of fight <eol> to raise through darkness the banner of light <eol>
