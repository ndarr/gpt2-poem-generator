ah whither , poor forsaken , wilt thou go <eol> to go from sorrow and thine own distress <eol> when every place presents like face of woe <eol> and no remove can make thy sorrows less <eol> yet go , forsaken ! leave these woods , these plains <eol> leave her and all , and all for her that leaves <eol> thee and thy love forlorn , and both disdains <eol> and of both wrongful deems and ill conceives <eol> seek out some place , and see if any place <eol> can give the least release unto thy grief <eol> convey thee from the thought of thy disgrace <eol> steal from thyself and be thy cares â€™ own thief <eol> but yet what comforts shall i hereby gain <eol> bearing the wound , i needs must feel the pain <eol>
