since i did leave the presence of my love <eol> many long weary dayes i have outworne <eol> and many nights , that slowly seemd to move <eol> theyr sad protract from evening untill morn <eol> for , when as day the heaven doth adorne <eol> i wish that night the noyous day would end <eol> and when as night hath us of light forlorne <eol> i wish that day would shortly reascend <eol> thus i the time with expectation spend <eol> and faine my griefe with chaunges to beguile <eol> that further seemes his terme still to extend <eol> and maketh every minute seem a myle <eol> so sorrowe still doth seem too long to last <eol> but ioyous houres do fly away too fast <eol>
