that day we brought our beautiful one to lie <eol> in the green peace within your gates , he came <eol> to give us greeting , boyish and kind and shy <eol> and , stricken as we were , we blessed his name <eol> yet , like the creature of light that had been ours <eol> soon of the sweet earth disinherited <eol> he too must join , even with the year 's old flowers <eol> the unanswering generations of the dead <eol> so stand we friends for you , who stood our friend <eol> through him that day ; for now through him you know <eol> that though where love was , love is till the end <eol> love , turned of death to longing , like a foe <eol> strikes : when the ruined heart goes forth to crave <eol> mercy of the high , austere , unpitying grave <eol>
