could'st thou resign the park and play , content <eol> for the fair banks of severn or of trent <eol> there might'st thou find some elegant retreat <eol> some hireling senator 's deserted seat <eol> and stretch thy prospects o'er the smiling land <eol> for less than rent the dungeons of the strand <eol> there prune thy walks , support thy drooping flowers <eol> direct thy rivulets , and twine thy bowers <eol> and , while thy grounds a cheap repast afford <eol> despise the dainties of a venal lord <eol> there every bush with nature 's music rings <eol> there every breeze bears health upon its wings <eol> on all thy hours security shall smile <eol> and bless thine evening walk and morning toil <eol>
