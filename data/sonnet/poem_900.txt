guarded within the old red wall 's embrace <eol> marshalled like soldiers in gay company <eol> the tulips stand arrayed . here infantry <eol> wheels out into the sunlight . what bold grace <eol> sets off their tunics , white with crimson lace <eol> here are platoons of gold frocked cavalry <eol> with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye <eol> of purple batteries , every gun in place <eol> forward they come , with flaunting colours spread <eol> with torches burning , stepping out in time <eol> to some quick , unheard march . our ears are dead <eol> we cannot catch the tune . in pantomime <eol> parades that army . with our utmost powers <eol> we hear the wind stream through a bed of flowers <eol>
