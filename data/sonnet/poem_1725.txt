the insect world , now sunbeams higher climb <eol> oft dream of spring , and wake before their time <eol> bees stroke their little legs across their wings <eol> and venture short flights where the snow drop hings <eol> its silver bell , and winter aconite <eol> its buttercup like flowers that shut at night <eol> with green leaf furling round its cup of gold <eol> like tender maiden muffled from the cold <eol> they sip and find their honey dreams are vain <eol> then feebly hasten to their hives again <eol> the butterflies , by eager hopes undone <eol> glad as a child come out to greet the sun <eol> beneath the shadows of a sunny shower <eol> are lost , nor see to morrow 's april flower <eol>
