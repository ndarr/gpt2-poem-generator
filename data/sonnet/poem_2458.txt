cromwell , our chief of men , who through a cloud <eol> not of war only , but detractions rude <eol> guided by faith and matchless fortitude <eol> to peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed <eol> and on the neck of crown Ã¨ d fortune proud <eol> hast reared god 's trophies , and his work pursued <eol> while darwen stream , with blood of scots imbrued <eol> and dunbar field , resounds thy praises loud <eol> and worcester 's laureate wreath : yet much remains <eol> to conquer still ; peace hath her victories <eol> no less renowned than war : new foes arise <eol> threatening to bind our souls with secular chains <eol> help us to save free conscience from the paw <eol> of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw <eol>
