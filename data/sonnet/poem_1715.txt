cold , cold we rested on black peaks again <eol> under black skies , under a groping wind <eol> and life , grown old , hugged me to a numb breast <eol> pressing numb lips against me . suddenly <eol> a blade of silver severed the black peaks <eol> from the black sky , and earth was born again <eol> breathing and various , under a god 's feet <eol> a god ! a god ! i felt the heart of life <eol> leap under me , and my cold flanks shook again <eol> he bore no lyre , he rang no challenge out <eol> but life warmed to him , warming me with her <eol> and as he neared i felt beneath her hands <eol> the stab of a new wound that sucked my soul <eol> forth in a new song from my throbbing throat <eol>
