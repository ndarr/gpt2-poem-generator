the tree of faith its bare , dry boughs must shed <eol> that nearer heaven the living ones may climb <eol> the false must fail , though from our shores of time <eol> the old lament be heard , â€œ great pan is dead <eol> that wail is error 's , from his high place hurled <eol> this sharp recoil is evil undertrod <eol> our time 's unrest , an angel sent of god <eol> troubling with life the waters of the world <eol> even as they list the winds of the spirit blow <eol> to turn or break our century rusted vanes <eol> sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains <eol> where , led of heaven , the strong tides come and go <eol> and storm clouds , rent by thunderbolt and wind <eol> leave , free of mist , the permanent stars behind <eol>
