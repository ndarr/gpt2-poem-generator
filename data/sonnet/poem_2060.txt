o ye who loved our grandmothers of yore <eol> fitzpatrick , sheridan , and many more <eol> and thou , my prince ! whose sovereign taste and will <eol> it is to love the lovely beldames still <eol> thou ghost of queensbury ! whose judging sprite <eol> satan may spare to peep a single night <eol> pronounce â€” if ever in your days of bliss <eol> asmodeus struck so bright a stroke as this <eol> to teach the young ideas how to rise <eol> flush in the cheek , and languish in the eyes <eol> rush to the heart , and lighten through the frame <eol> with half told wish and ill dissembled flame <eol> for prurient nature still will storm the breast <eol> who , tempted thus , can answer for the rest <eol>
