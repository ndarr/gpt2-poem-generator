down the strait vistas where a city street <eol> fades in pale dust and vaporous distances <eol> stained with far fumes the light grows less and less <eol> and the sky reddens round the day 's retreat <eol> now out of orient chambers , cool and sweet <eol> like nature 's pure lustration , dusk comes down <eol> now the lamps brighten and the quickening town <eol> rings with the trample of returning feet <eol> and pleasure , risen from her own warm mould <eol> sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight <eol> in layers of odorous softness , paphian girls <eol> cover with gauze , with satin , and with pearls <eol> crown , and about her spangly vestments fold <eol> the ermine of the empire of the night <eol>
