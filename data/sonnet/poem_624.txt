sweet spirits of the beautiful ! where'er ye dwell <eol> whether upon the misty mountain tops <eol> with mantling crags about ye , or in dell <eol> and sunny valley , by the hazel copse <eol> wherein the ring dove nestles , or by streams <eol> that wander amid woodlands , with the sheen <eol> of noontide trembling through the leafy screen <eol> down to their mossy banks in fitful gleams <eol> that murmur with the linnets and at e'en <eol> sigh with the plaintive nightingale , and oft <eol> mirror your bright eyes in the sparkling dew <eol> circle me ever with your joyous crew <eol> bring inspirations to me bland and soft <eol> and sun my slumbers still with happy dreams <eol>
