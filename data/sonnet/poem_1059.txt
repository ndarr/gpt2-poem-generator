at the round earth 's imagined corners blow <eol> your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise <eol> from death , you numberless infinities <eol> of souls , and to your scattered bodies go <eol> all whom the flood did , and fire shall , overthrow <eol> all whom war , death , age , ague 's tyrannies <eol> despair , law , chance , hath slain ; and you whose eyes <eol> shall behold god , and never taste death 's woe <eol> but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space <eol> for if above all these my sins abound <eol> â€˜ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace <eol> when we are there . here on this holy ground <eol> teach me how to repent , for that 's as good <eol> as if thou hadst sealed my pardon with thy blood <eol>
