when from the prison of its body free <eol> my soul shall soar , before it goes to thee <eol> thou great creator , give it power to know <eol> the language of all sad , dumb things below <eol> and let me dwell a season still on earth <eol> before i rise to some diviner birth <eol> invisible to men , yet seen and heard <eol> and understood by sorrowing beast and bird   <eol> invisible to men , yet always near <eol> to whisper counsel in the human ear <eol> and with a spell to stay the hunter 's hand <eol> and stir his heart to know and understand <eol> to plant within the dull or thoughtless mind <eol> the great religious impulse to be kind <eol>
