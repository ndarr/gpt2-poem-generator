another battle ! and the sounds have rolled <eol> by many a gloomy gorge and wasted plain <eol> o'er huddled hills and mountains manifold <eol> like winds that run before a heavy rain <eol> when autumn lops the leaves and drooping grain <eol> and earth lies deep in brown and cloudy gold <eol> my brothers , lo ! our grand old england stands <eol> with weapons gleaming in her ready hands <eol> outside the tumult ! let us watch and trust <eol> that she will never darken in the dust <eol> and drift of wild contention , but remain <eol> the hope and stay of many troubled lands <eol> where so she waits the issue of the fight <eol> aloof ; but praying â€œ god defend the right <eol>
