through the hushed street , along the silent plain <eol> the spectral future leads its mourning train <eol> dark with the shadows of uncounted bands <eol> where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands <eol> track the still burden , rolling slow before <eol> that love and kindness can protect no more <eol> the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife <eol> shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life <eol> the drooping child who prays in vain to live <eol> and pleads for help its parent cannot give <eol> the pride of beauty stricken in its flower <eol> the strength of manhood broken in an hour <eol> age in its weakness , bowed by toil and care <eol> traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair <eol>
