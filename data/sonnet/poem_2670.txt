calm is all nature as a resting wheel <eol> the kine are couch 'd upon the dewy grass <eol> the horse alone , seen dimly as i pass <eol> is up , and cropping yet his later meal <eol> dark is the ground ; a slumber seems to steal <eol> o'er vale , and mountain , and the starless sky <eol> now , in this blank of things , a harmony <eol> home felt , and home created seems to heal <eol> that grief for which the senses still supply <eol> fresh food ; for only then , when memory <eol> is hush 'd , am i at rest . my friends , restrain <eol> those busy cares that would allay my pain <eol> oh ! leave me to myself ; nor let me feel <eol> the officious touch that makes me droop again <eol>
