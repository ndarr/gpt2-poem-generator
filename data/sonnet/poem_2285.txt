a graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve <eol> venice and winter , hand in deadly hand <eol> have slain the lover of her sunbright strand <eol> and singer of a stormbright christmas eve <eol> a graceless guerdon we that loved receive <eol> for all our love , from that the dearest land <eol> love worshipped ever . blithe and soft and bland <eol> too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave <eol> shone on our dreams and memories evermore <eol> the domes , the towers , the mountains and the shore <eol> that gird or guard thee , venice : cold and black <eol> seems now the face we loved as he of yore <eol> we have given thee love â€” no stint , no stay , no lack <eol> what gift , what gift is this thou hast given us back <eol>
