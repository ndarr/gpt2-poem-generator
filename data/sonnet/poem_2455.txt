come walk with me along this willowed lane <eol> where , like lost coinage from some miser 's store <eol> the golden dandelions more and more <eol> glow , as the warm sun kisses them again <eol> for this is may ! who with a daisy chain <eol> leads on the laughing hours ; for now is o'er <eol> long winter 's trance . no longer rise and roar <eol> his forest wrenching blasts . the hopeful swain <eol> along the furrow , sings behind his team <eol> loud pipes the redbreast â€” troubadour of spring <eol> and vocal all the morning copses ring <eol> more blue the skies in lucent lakelets gleam <eol> and the glad earth , caressed by murmuring showers <eol> wakes like a bride , to deck herself with flowers <eol>
