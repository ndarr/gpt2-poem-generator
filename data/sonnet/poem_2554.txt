sweet summer queen , with trailing robe of green <eol> what spell has thou to bind the heart to thee <eol> thy throne is built upon the sun lit sea <eol> where break the waves in clouds of silver sheen <eol> and oft at dawn like some resplendent queen <eol> thou sittest on the hills in majesty <eol> and all the flowers wake at thy decree <eol> but now farewell to all thy joys serene <eol> the autumn comes with swift winged , silent flight <eol> and he will woo thee with his fiery breath <eol> in crimson robes and hues of flashing gold <eol> he 'll clothe thee , and thy beauty in the night <eol> will take a richer glow . but wintry death <eol> will come and wrap thee in his fold <eol>
