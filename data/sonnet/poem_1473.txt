they knelt in silent anguish by her bed <eol> and could not weep ; but calmly there she lay <eol> all pain had left her ; and the sun 's last ray <eol> shone through upon her , warming into red <eol> the shady curtains . in her heart she said <eol> “ heaven opens ; i leave these and go away <eol> the bridegroom calls ,— shall the bride seek to stay <eol> then low upon her breast she bowed her head <eol> o lily flower , o gem of priceless worth <eol> o dove with patient voice and patient eyes <eol> o fruitful vine amid a land of dearth <eol> o maid replete with loving purities <eol> thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth <eol> to raise it with the saints in paradise <eol>
