three men lived yet when this dead man was young <eol> whose names and words endure for ever : one <eol> whose eyes grew dim with straining toward the sun <eol> and his wings weakened , and his angel 's tongue <eol> lost half the sweetest song was ever sung <eol> but like the strain half uttered earth hears none <eol> nor shall man hear till all men 's songs are done <eol> one whose clear spirit like an eagle hung <eol> between the mountains hallowed by his love <eol> and the sky stainless as his soul above <eol> and one the sweetest heart that ever spake <eol> the brightest words wherein sweet wisdom smiled <eol> these deathless names by this dead snake defiled <eol> bid memory spit upon him for their sake <eol>
