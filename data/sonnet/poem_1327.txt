time flies , hope flags , life plies a wearied wing <eol> death following hard on life gains ground apace <eol> faith runs with each and rears an eager face <eol> outruns the rest , makes light of everything <eol> spurns earth , and still finds breath to pray and sing <eol> while love ahead of all uplifts his praise <eol> still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace <eol> content with all day brings and night will bring <eol> life wanes ; and when love folds his wings above <eol> tired hope , and less we feel his conscious pulse <eol> let us go fall asleep , dear friend , in peace <eol> a little while , and age and sorrow cease <eol> a little while , and life reborn annuls <eol> loss and decay and death , and all is love <eol>
