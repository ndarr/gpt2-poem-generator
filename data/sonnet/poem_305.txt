from you have i been absent in the spring <eol> when proud pied april ( dressed in all his trim <eol> hath put a spirit of youth in every thing <eol> that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him <eol> yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell <eol> of different flowers in odour and in hue <eol> could make me any summer 's story tell <eol> or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew <eol> nor did i wonder at the lily 's white <eol> nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose <eol> they were but sweet , but figures of delight <eol> drawn after you , you pattern of all those <eol> yet seemed it winter still , and you away <eol> as with your shadow i with these did play <eol>
