beloved , my beloved , when i think <eol> that thou wast in the world a year ago <eol> what time i sat alone here in the snow <eol> and saw no footprint , heard the silence sink <eol> no moment at thy voice , but , link by link <eol> went counting all my chains as if that so <eol> they never could fall off at any blow <eol> struck by thy possible hand ,— why , thus i drink <eol> of life 's great cup of wonder ! wonderful <eol> never to feel thee thrill the day or night <eol> with personal act or speech ,— nor ever cull <eol> some prescience of thee with the blossoms white <eol> thou sawest growing ! atheists are as dull <eol> who cannot guess god 's presence out of sight <eol>
