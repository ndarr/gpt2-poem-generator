lord , if i love thee and thou lovest me <eol> why need i any more these toilsome days <eol> why should i not run singing up thy ways <eol> straight into heaven , to rest myself with thee <eol> what need remains of death pang yet to be <eol> if all my soul is quickened in thy praise <eol> if all my heart loves thee , what need the amaze <eol> struggle and dimness of an agony <eol> bride whom i love , if thou too lovest me <eol> thou needs must choose my likeness for thy dower <eol> so wilt thou toil in patience , and abide <eol> hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour <eol> when i my likeness shall behold in thee <eol> and thou therein shalt waken satisfied <eol>
