i do not now complain of my disgrace <eol> o cruel fair one ! fair with cruel crost <eol> nor of the hour , season , time , nor place <eol> nor of my foil , for any freedom lost <eol> nor of my courage , by misfortune daunted <eol> nor of my wit , by overweening struck <eol> nor of my sense , by any sound enchanted <eol> nor of the force of fiery pointed hook <eol> nor of the steel that sticks within my wound <eol> nor of my thoughts , by worser thoughts defaced <eol> nor of the life i labour to confound <eol> but i complain , that being thus disgraced <eol> fired , feared , frantic , fettered , shot through , slain <eol> my death is such as i may not complain <eol>
