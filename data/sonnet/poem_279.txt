the silver trumpets rang across the dome <eol> the people knelt upon the ground with awe <eol> and borne upon the necks of men i saw <eol> like some great god , the holy lord of rome <eol> priest like , he wore a robe more white than foam <eol> and , king like , swathed himself in royal red <eol> three crowns of gold rose high upon his head <eol> in splendour and in light the pope passed home <eol> my heart stole back across wide wastes of years <eol> to one who wandered by a lonely sea <eol> and sought in vain for any place of rest <eol> â€˜ foxes have holes , and every bird its nest <eol> i , only i , must wander wearily <eol> and bruise my feet , and drink wine salt with tears <eol>
