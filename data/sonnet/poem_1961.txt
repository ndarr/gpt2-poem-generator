look how the pale queen of the silent night <eol> doth cause the ocean to attend upon her <eol> and he , as long as she is in his sight <eol> with his full tide is ready her to honor <eol> but when the silver wagon of the moon <eol> is mounted up so high he cannot follow <eol> the sea calls home his crystal waves to moan <eol> and with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow <eol> so you that are the sovereign of my heart <eol> have all my joys attending on your will <eol> my joys low ebbing when you do depart <eol> when you return , their tide my heart doth fill <eol> so as you come , and as you do depart <eol> joys ebb and flow within my tender heart <eol>
