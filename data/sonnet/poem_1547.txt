a harry of hoofs in a village street <eol> a shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark <eol> and beneath from the pebbles , in passing , a spark <eol> struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet <eol> that was all ! and yet , through the gloom and the light <eol> the fate of a nation was riding that night <eol> and the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight <eol> kindled the land into flame with its heat <eol> he has left the village and mounted the steep <eol> and beneath him , tranquil and broad and deep <eol> is the mystic , meeting the ocean tides <eol> and under the alders , that skirt its edge <eol> now soft on the sand , now loud on the ledge <eol> is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides <eol>
