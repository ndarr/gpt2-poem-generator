if so it hap this offspring of my care <eol> these fatal anthems , lamentable songs <eol> come to their view , who like afflicted are <eol> let them yet sigh their own , and moan my wrongs <eol> but untouched hearts with unaffected eye <eol> approach not to behold my soul 's distress <eol> clear sighted you soon note what is awry <eol> whilst blinded souls mine errors never guess <eol> you blinded souls , whom youth and error lead <eol> you outcast eaglets dazzled with your sun <eol> do you , and none but you , my sorrows read <eol> you best can judge the wrongs that she hath done <eol> that she hath done , the motive of my pain <eol> who whilst i love doth kill me with disdain <eol>
