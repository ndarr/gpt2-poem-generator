men see their god , an immanence divine <eol> smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay <eol> in bare ploughed lands that go sloping away <eol> to meet the sky in one clean exquisite line <eol> out of the short seen dawns of ecstasy <eol> they draw new beauty , whence new thoughts are born <eol> and in their turn conceive , as grains of corn <eol> germ and create new life and endlessly <eol> shall live creating . out of earthly seeds <eol> springs the aerial flower . one spirit proceeds <eol> through change , the same in body and in soul <eol> the spirit of life and love that triumphs still <eol> in its slow struggle towards some far off goal <eol> through lust and death and the bitterness of will <eol>
