the hope of truth grows stronger , day by day <eol> i hear the soul of man around me waking <eol> like a great sea , its frozen fetters breaking <eol> and flinging up to heaven its sunlit spray <eol> tossing huge continents in scornful play <eol> and crushing them , with din of grinding thunder <eol> that makes old emptinesses stare in wonder <eol> the memory of a glory passed away <eol> lingers in every heart , as , in the shell <eol> resounds the bygone freedom of the sea <eol> and every hour new signs of promise tell <eol> that the great soul shall once again be free <eol> for high , and yet more high , the murmurs swell <eol> of inward strife for truth and liberty <eol>
