peace hath an altar there . the sounding feet <eol> of thunder and the â€˜ wildering wings of rain <eol> against fire rifted summits flash and beat <eol> and through grey upper gorges swoop and strain <eol> but round that hallowed mountain spring remain <eol> year after year , the days of tender heat <eol> and gracious nights , whose lips with flowers are sweet <eol> and filtered lights , and lutes of soft refrain <eol> a still , bright pool . to men i may not tell <eol> the secret that its heart of water knows <eol> the story of a loved and lost repose <eol> yet this i say to cliff and close leaved dell <eol> a fitful spirit haunts yon limpid well <eol> whose likeness is the faithless face of rose <eol>
