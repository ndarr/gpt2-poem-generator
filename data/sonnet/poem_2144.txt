river , that stealest with such silent pace <eol> around the city of the dead , where lies <eol> a friend who bore thy name , and whom these eyes <eol> shall see no more in his accustomed place <eol> linger and fold him in thy soft embrace <eol> and say good night , for now the western skies <eol> are red with sunset , and gray mists arise <eol> like damps that gather on a dead man 's face <eol> good night ! good night ! as we so oft have said <eol> beneath this roof at midnight in the days <eol> that are no more , and shall no more return <eol> thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed <eol> i stay a little longer , as one stays <eol> to cover up the embers that still burn <eol>
