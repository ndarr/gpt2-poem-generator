woe to mine eyes , the organs of mine ill <eol> hate to my heart , for not concealing joy <eol> a double curse upon my tongue be still <eol> whose babbling lost what else i might enjoy <eol> when first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy <eol> they to my heart thy wondrous virtues told <eol> who , fearing lest thy beams should him destroy <eol> whate'er he knew , did to my tongue unfold <eol> my tell tale tongue , in talking over bold <eol> what they in private council did declare <eol> to thee , in plain and public terms unrolled <eol> and so by that made thee more coyer far <eol> what in thy praise he spoke , that didst thou trust <eol> and yet my sorrows thou dost hold unjust <eol>
