if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks <eol> what outbursts of pent glories , what new grace <eol> had shone upon us from the great world 's face <eol> how had we read , as in eternal books <eol> the love of god in loneliest shiest nooks <eol> a lily , in merest lines thy hand did trace <eol> had plainly been god 's child of lower race <eol> and oh how strong the hills , songful the brooks <eol> to thee all nature 's meanings lie light bare <eol> because thy heart is nature 's inner side <eol> clear as , to us , earth on the dawn 's gold tide <eol> her notion vast up in thy soul did rise <eol> thine is the world , thine all its splendours rare <eol> thou man ideal , with the unsleeping eyes <eol>
