in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes <eol> for they in thee a thousand errors note <eol> but â€˜ tis my heart that loves what they despise <eol> who in despite of view is pleased to dote <eol> nor are mine cars with thy tongue 's tune delighted <eol> nor tender feeling to base touches prone <eol> nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited <eol> to any sensual feast with thee alone <eol> but my five wits , nor my five senses can <eol> dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee <eol> who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man <eol> thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be <eol> only my plague thus far i count my gain <eol> that she that makes me sin , awards me pain <eol>
