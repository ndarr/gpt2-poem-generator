friend of the dead , and friend of all my days <eol> even since they cast off boyhood , i salute <eol> the song saluting friends whose songs are mute <eol> with full burnt offerings of clear spirited praise <eol> that since our old young years our several ways <eol> have led through fields diverse of flower and fruit <eol> yet no cross wind has once relaxed the root <eol> we set long since beneath the sundawn 's rays <eol> the root of trust whence towered the trusty tree <eol> friendship — this only and duly might impel <eol> my song to salutation of your own <eol> more even than praise of one unseen of me <eol> and loved — the starry spirit of dobell <eol> to mine by light and music only known <eol>
