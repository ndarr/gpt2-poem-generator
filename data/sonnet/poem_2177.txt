into a stately dwelling dark and old <eol> a woman glides with troubled , weary air <eol> her face is pale , her hands are white and cold <eol> the silken hood falls from her loosened hair <eol> she heeds it not , but listlessly stands <eol> with thoughtful eyes and tightly folded hands <eol> at last the maid with noiseless step draws near <eol> removes her wraps and in her listening ear <eol> speaks these few words : â€œ in passing through the crowd <eol> to night , a man of face and manner proud <eol> this missive gave to me . i looked around <eol> for one brief moment his face upon me frowned <eol> then he was gone , and though i scanned the street <eol> his form again my glances did not meet <eol>
