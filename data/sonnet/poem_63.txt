sweet love renew thy force , be it not said <eol> thy edge should blunter be than appetite <eol> which but to day by feeding is allayed <eol> to morrow sharpened in his former might <eol> so love be thou , although to day thou fill <eol> thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness <eol> to morrow see again , and do not kill <eol> the spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness <eol> let this sad interim like the ocean be <eol> which parts the shore , where two contracted new <eol> come daily to the banks , that when they see <eol> return of love , more blest may be the view <eol> or call it winter , which being full of care <eol> makes summer 's welcome , thrice more wished , more rare <eol>
