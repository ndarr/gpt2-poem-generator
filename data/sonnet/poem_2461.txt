not in such grief she left her country 's shores <eol> when caesar 's host drew near ; for now she leaves <eol> though faithful to her lord , his side in flight <eol> and flees her spouse . all that next night she waked <eol> then first what means a widowed couch she knew <eol> its cold , its solitude . when slumber found <eol> her eyelids , and forgetfulness her soul <eol> seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved <eol> she grasps but air . though tossed by restless love <eol> she leaves a place beside her as for him <eol> returning . yet she feared pompeius lost <eol> to her for ever . but the gods ordained <eol> worse than her fears , and in the hour of woe <eol> gave her to look upon his face again <eol>
