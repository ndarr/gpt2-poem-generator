was it the moon , or was it morning 's ray <eol> that call 'd thee , dearest , from these arms away <eol> scarce hadst thou left me , when a dream of night <eol> came o'er my spirit so distinct and bright <eol> that , while i yet can vividly recall <eol> its witching wonders , thou shall hear them all <eol> methought i saw , upon the lunar beam <eol> two winged boys , such as thy muse might dream <eol> descending from above , at that still hour <eol> and gliding , with smooth step , into my bower <eol> fair as the beauteous spirits that , all day <eol> in amatha 's warm founts imprisoned stay <eol> but rise at midnight , from the enchanted rill <eol> to cool their plumes upon some moonlight hill <eol>
