god hides in nature as a thought doth hide <eol> in humbly sounding words ; and as the thought <eol> beats through the lowly word like pulse of heart <eol> that giveth life and keepeth life alive <eol> so god , thro ’ nature , works on ev'ry soul <eol> for nature is his word so strangely writ <eol> in heav'n , in all the letters of the stars <eol> beneath the stars in alphabets of clouds <eol> and on the seas in syllables of waves <eol> and in the earth , on all the leaves of flowers <eol> and on the grasses and the stately trees <eol> and on the rivers and the mournful rocks <eol> the word is clearly written ; blest are they <eol> who read the word aright — and understand <eol>
