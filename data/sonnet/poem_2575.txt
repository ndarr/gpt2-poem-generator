i say unto all hearts that cannot rest <eol> for want of love , for beating loud and lonely <eol> pray the great mercy god to give you only <eol> love that is passionless within the breast <eol> pray that it may not be a haunting fire <eol> a vision that shall steal insatiably <eol> all beauteous content , all sweet desire <eol> from faith and dream , star , flower , and song , and sea <eol> but seek that soul and soul may meet together <eol> knowing they have forever been but one <eol> meet and be surest when ill 's chartless weather <eol> drives blinding gales of doubt across their sun <eol> pray â€” pray ! lost love uptorn shall seem as nether <eol> hell hate and rage beyond oblivion <eol>
