fair grace of graces , muse of muses all <eol> thou paradise , thou only heaven i know <eol> what influence hath bred my hateful woe <eol> that i from thee and them am forced to fall <eol> thou falled from me , from thee i never shall <eol> although my fortunes thou hast brought so low <eol> yet shall my faith and service with thee go <eol> for live i do , on heaven and thee to call <eol> banish 'd all grace , no graces with me dwell <eol> compelled to muse , my muses from me fly <eol> excluded heaven , what can remain but hell <eol> exiled from paradise , in hate i lie <eol> cursing my stars ; albeit i find it true <eol> i lost all these when i lost love and you <eol>
