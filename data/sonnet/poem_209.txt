this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint <eol> my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race <eol> idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace <eol> my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point <eol> and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint <eol> my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space <eol> but my ever waking part shall see that face <eol> whose fear already shakes my every joint <eol> then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight <eol> and earth born body in the earth shall dwell <eol> so fall my sins , that all may have their right <eol> to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell <eol> impute me righteous ; thus purged of evil <eol> for thus i leave the world , the flesh , the devil <eol>
