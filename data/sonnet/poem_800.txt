then welcome be it , if indeed it be <eol> the irrepressible conflict ! let it come <eol> there will be mitigation of the doom <eol> if , battling to the last , our sires shall see <eol> their sons contending for the homes made free <eol> in ancient conflict with the foreign foe <eol> if those who call us brethren strike the blow <eol> no common conflict shall the invader know <eol> war to the knife , and to the last , until <eol> the sacred land we keep shall overflow <eol> with blood as sacred — valley , wave , and hill <eol> or the last enemy finds his bloody grave <eol> aye , welcome to your graves — or ours ! the brave <eol> may perish , but ye shall not bind one slave <eol>
