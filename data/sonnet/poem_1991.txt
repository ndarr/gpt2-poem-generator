patience , long sick to death , is dead . too long <eol> have sloth and doubt and treason bidden us be <eol> what cromwell 's england was not , when the sea <eol> to him bore witness given of blake how strong <eol> she stood , a commonweal that brooked no wrong <eol> from foes less vile than men like wolves set free <eol> whose war is waged where none may fight or flee <eol> with women and with weanlings . speech and song <eol> lack utterance now for loathing . scarce we hear <eol> foul tongues that blacken god 's dishonoured name <eol> with prayers turned curses and with praise found shame <eol> defy the truth whose witness now draws near <eol> to scourge these dogs , agape with jaws afoam <eol> down out of life . strike , england , and strike home <eol>
