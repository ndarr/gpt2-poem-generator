the scourge of life , and death 's extreme disgrace <eol> the smoke of hell , the monster called pain <eol> long shamed to be accursed in every place <eol> by them who of his rude resort complain <eol> like crafty wretch , by time and travel taught <eol> his ugly evil in others â€™ good to hide <eol> late harbours in her face , whom nature wrought <eol> as treasure house where her best gifts do bide <eol> and so by privilege of sacred seat <eol> a seat where beauty shines and virtue reigns <eol> he hopes for some small praise , since she hath great <eol> within her beams wrapping his cruel stains <eol> ah , saucy pain , let not thy terror last <eol> more loving eyes she draws , more hate thou hast <eol>
