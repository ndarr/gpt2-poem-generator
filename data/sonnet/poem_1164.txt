an anthem of a sister choristry <eol> and like a windward murmur of the sea <eol> o'er silver shells , so solemnly it falls <eol> a dying music shrouded in deep walls <eol> that bury its wild breathings ! and the moon <eol> of glow worm hue , like virgin in sad swoon <eol> lies coldly on the bosom of a cloud <eol> until the elf winds , that are wailing loud <eol> do minister unto her sickly trance <eol> fanning the life into her countenance <eol> and there are pale stars sparkling , far and few <eol> in the deep chasms of everlasting blue <eol> unmarshall 'd and ungather 'd , one and one <eol> like outposts of the lunar garrison <eol>
