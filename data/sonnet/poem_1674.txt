when love puffed up with rage of high disdain <eol> resolved to make me pattern of his might <eol> like foe , whose wits inclined to deadly spite <eol> would often kill , to breed more feeling pain <eol> he would not , armed with beauty , only reign <eol> on those affects which easily yield to sight <eol> but virtue sets so high , that reason 's light <eol> for all his strife can only bondage gain <eol> so that i live to pay a mortal fee <eol> dead palsy sick of all my chiefest parts <eol> like those whom dreams make ugly monsters see <eol> and can cry help with naught but groans and starts <eol> longing to have , having no wit to wish <eol> to starving minds such is god cupid 's dish <eol>
