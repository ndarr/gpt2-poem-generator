not love of you is most that i can bring <eol> since what i am to love you is the test <eol> and should i love you more than any thing <eol> you would but be of idle love possessed <eol> a mere love wandering in appetite <eol> counting your glories and yet bringing none <eol> finding in you occasions of delight <eol> a thief of payment for no service done <eol> but when of labouring life i make a song <eol> and bring it you , as that were my reward <eol> to let what most is me to you belong <eol> then do i come of high possessions lord <eol> and loving life more than my love of you <eol> i give you love more excellently true <eol>
