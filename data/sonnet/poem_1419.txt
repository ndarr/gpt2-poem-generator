how many bards gild the lapses of time <eol> a few of them have ever been the food <eol> of my delighted fancy ,— i could brood <eol> over their beauties , earthly , or sublime <eol> and often , when i sit me down to rhyme <eol> these will in throngs before my mind intrude <eol> but no confusion , no disturbance rude <eol> do they occasion ; ‘ tis a pleasing chime <eol> so the unnumber 'd sounds that evening store <eol> the songs of birds — the whisp'ring of the leaves <eol> the voice of waters — the great bell that heaves <eol> with solemn sound ,— and thousand others more <eol> that distance of recognizance bereaves <eol> make pleasing music , and not wild uproar <eol>
