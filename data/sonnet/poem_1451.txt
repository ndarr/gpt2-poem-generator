day after day i dreamed there , while my heart <eol> gathered up knowledge in its childish way <eol> making fine pictures with unconscious art <eol> and learning beauty more and more each day <eol> ever and ever haunted i that spot <eol> sitting in dells scooped out between the hills <eol> that rising close around me , formed a grot <eol> fragrant with ferns , and musical with rills <eol> far up above me grew the long armed beech <eol> dropping its branches down in graceful bent <eol> while farther up , beyond my utmost reach <eol> stood dusky hemlocks , crowning the ascent <eol> and all about were sweeter sights and sounds <eol> than elsewhere , but in poet 's dream , abounds <eol>
