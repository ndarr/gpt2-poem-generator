my love lay sleeping , where birds music made <eol> shutting her eyes , disdainful of the light <eol> the heat was great but greater was the shade <eol> which her defended from his burning sight <eol> this cupid saw , and came a kiss to take <eol> sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath <eol> she felt the touch , and blushed , and did awake <eol> seeing t'was love , which she did think was death <eol> she cut his wings and caus è d him to stay <eol> making a vow , he should not thence depart <eol> unless to her the wanton boy could pay <eol> the truest , kindest and most loving heart <eol> his feathers still she us è d for a fan <eol> till by exchange my heart his feathers won <eol>
