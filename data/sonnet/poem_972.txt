love is too young to know what conscience is <eol> yet who knows not conscience is born of love <eol> then gentle cheater urge not my amiss <eol> lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove <eol> for thou betraying me , i do betray <eol> my nobler part to my gross body 's treason <eol> my soul doth tell my body that he may <eol> triumph in love , flesh stays no farther reason <eol> but rising at thy name doth point out thee <eol> as his triumphant prize , proud of this pride <eol> he is contented thy poor drudge to be <eol> to stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side <eol> no want of conscience hold it that i call <eol> her love , for whose dear love i rise and fall <eol>
