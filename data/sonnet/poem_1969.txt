o spring , that flutter'st the slow winter by <eol> to drop thy buds before his frosty feet <eol> dost thou not grieve to see thy darlings lie <eol> in trodden death , and weep their beauty sweet <eol> yet must thou cast thy tender offering <eol> and make thy way above thy mourn è d dead <eol> or frowning winter would be always king <eol> and thou wouldst never walk with crown è d head <eol> so gentle love must make his venturous way <eol> among the shaken buds of his own pain <eol> and many a hope blown garland meekly lay <eol> before the chilly season of disdain <eol> but as no beauty may the spring outglow <eol> so he , when throned , no greater lord doth know <eol>
