such gifts are sweetest when unsought . to me <eol> as i was loitering lately in my dreams <eol> passing from one remembrance to another <eol> like him who reads upon an outstretched map <eol> content and idly happy , these rose up <eol> out of that magic well stored picture house <eol> no dream , rather a thing most keenly real <eol> the memory of a moment , when with feet <eol> arrested and spell bound , and captured eyes <eol> made wide with joy and wonder , i beheld <eol> the spaces of a white and wintery land <eol> swept with the fire of sunset , all its width <eol> vale , forest , town , and misty eminence <eol> a miracle of color and of beauty <eol>
