poet ! if on a lasting fame be bent <eol> thy unperturbing hopes , thou will not roam <eol> too far from thine own happy heart and home <eol> cling to the lowly earth , and be content <eol> so shall thy name be dear to many a heart <eol> so shall the noblest truths by thee be taught <eol> the flower and fruit of wholesome human thought <eol> bless the sweet labors of thy gentle art <eol> the brightest stars are nearest to the earth <eol> and we may track the mighty sun above <eol> even by the shadow of a slender flower <eol> always , o bard , humility is power <eol> and thou mayst draw from matters of the hearth <eol> truths wide as nations , and as deep as love <eol>
