once in a dream ( for once i dreamed of you <eol> we stood together in an open field <eol> above our heads two swift winged pigeons wheeled <eol> sporting at ease and courting full in view <eol> when loftier still a broadening darkness flew <eol> down swooping , and a ravenous hawk revealed <eol> too weak to fight , too fond to fly , they yield <eol> so farewell life and love and pleasures new <eol> then as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground <eol> their snow white plumage flecked with crimson drops <eol> i wept , and thought i turned towards you to weep <eol> but you were gone ; while rustling hedgerow tops <eol> bent in a wind which bore to me a sound <eol> of far off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep <eol>
