flowers i would bring if flowers could make thee fairer <eol> and music , if the muse were dear to thee <eol> ( for loving these would make thee love the bearer <eol> but sweetest songs forget their melody <eol> and loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer <eol> a rose i marked , and might have plucked ; but she <eol> blushed as she bent , imploring me to spare her <eol> nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry <eol> alas ! and with what gifts shall i pursue thee <eol> what offerings bring , what treasures lay before thee <eol> when earth with all her floral train doth woo thee <eol> and all old poets and old songs adore thee <eol> and love to thee is naught ; from passionate mood <eol> secured by joy 's complacent plenitude <eol>
