you ask me for a sonnet . ah , my dear <eol> can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon <eol> can cracked and fallen leaves recall last june <eol> and leap up on the boughs , now stiff and sere <eol> for your sake , i would go and seek the year <eol> faded beyond the purple ranks of dune <eol> blown sands of drifted hours , which the moon <eol> streaks with a ghostly finger , and her sneer <eol> pulls at my lengthening shadow . yes , â€˜ tis that <eol> my shadow stretches forward , and the ground <eol> is dark in front because the light 's behind <eol> it is grotesque , with such a funny hat <eol> in watching it and walking i have found <eol> more than enough to occupy my mind <eol>
