fair was the maid , and lovely as the morn <eol> from starry night and rosy twilight born <eol> within whose mind a rivulet of song <eol> rehearsed the strains that from her lips ere long <eol> welled free and sparkling , as the vocal woods <eol> repeat the day spring 's sweetest interludes <eol> her gentle eyes â€™ serenest depths of blue <eol> shrined love and truth , and all their retinue <eol> the health and beauty of her youthful face <eol> made it the harem of each maiden grace <eol> and such perfection blended with her air <eol> she seemed some stately goddess moving there <eol> beholding her , you thought she might have been <eol> the long lost , flower loving proserpine <eol>
