take down thy stars , o god ! we look not up <eol> in vain thou hangest there thy changeless sign <eol> we lift our eyes to power 's glowing cup <eol> nor care if blood make strong that wizard wine <eol> so we but drink and feel the sorcery <eol> of conquest in our veins , of wits grown keen <eol> in strain and strife for flesh sweet sovereignty <eol> the fatal thrill of kingship over men <eol> what though the soul be from the body shrunk <eol> and we array the temple , but no god <eol> what though , the cup of golden greed once drunk <eol> our dust be laid in a dishonoured sod <eol> while thy loud hosts proclaim the end of wars <eol> we read no sign . o god , take down thy stars <eol>
