thou who didst waken from his summer dreams <eol> the blue mediterranean , where he lay <eol> lull 'd by the coil of his crystalline streams <eol> beside a pumice isle in baiae 's bay <eol> and saw in sleep old palaces and towers <eol> quivering within the wave 's intenser day <eol> all overgrown with azure moss and flowers <eol> so sweet , the sense faints picturing them ! thou <eol> for whose path the atlantic 's level powers <eol> cleave themselves into chasms , while far below <eol> the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear <eol> the sapless foliage of the ocean , know <eol> thy voice , and suddenly grow gray with fear <eol> and tremble and despoil themselves : o hear <eol>
