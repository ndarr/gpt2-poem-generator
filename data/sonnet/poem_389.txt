the last and greatest herald of heaven 's king <eol> girt with rough skins , hies to the deserts wild <eol> among that savage brood the woods forth bring <eol> which he more harmless found than man , and mild <eol> his food was locusts , and what there doth spring <eol> with honey that from virgin hives distill 'd <eol> parch 'd body , hollow eyes , some uncouth thing <eol> made him appear , long since from earth exiled <eol> there burst he forth ; ‘ all ye whose hopes rely <eol> on god , with me amidst these deserts mourn <eol> repent , repent , and from old errors turn <eol> who listen 'd to his voice , obey 'd his cry <eol> only the echoes , which he made relent <eol> rung from their flinty caves , ‘ repent , repent <eol>
