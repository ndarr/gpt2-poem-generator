resolved to love , unworthy to obtain <eol> i do no favour crave ; but , humble wise <eol> to thee my sighs in verse i sacrifice <eol> only some pity and no help to gain <eol> hear then , and as my heart shall aye remain <eol> a patient object to thy lightning eyes <eol> a patient ear bring thou to thund'ring cries <eol> fear not the crack , when i the blow sustain <eol> so as thine eye bred mine ambitious thought <eol> so shall thine ear make proud my voice for joy <eol> lo , dear , what wonders great by thee are wrought <eol> when i but little favour do enjoy <eol> the voice is made the ear for to rejoice <eol> and your ear giveth pleasure to my voice <eol>
