cherish you then the hope i shall forget <eol> at length , my lord , pieria ?— put away <eol> for your so passing sake , this mouth of clay <eol> these mortal bones against my body set <eol> for all the puny fever and frail sweat <eol> of human love ,— renounce for these , i say <eol> the singing mountain 's memory , and betray <eol> the silent lyre that hangs upon me yet <eol> ah , but indeed , some day shall you awake <eol> rather , from dreams of me , that at your side <eol> so many nights , a lover and a bride <eol> but stern in my soul 's chastity , have lain <eol> to walk the world forever for my sake <eol> and in each chamber find me gone again <eol>
