the holly bush , a sober lump of green <eol> shines through the leafless shrubs all brown and grey <eol> and smiles at winter be it eer so keen <eol> with all the leafy luxury of may <eol> and o it is delicious , when the day <eol> in winter 's loaded garment keenly blows <eol> and turns her back on sudden falling snows <eol> to go where gravel pathways creep between <eol> arches of evergreen that scarce let through <eol> a single feather of the driving storm <eol> and in the bitterest day that ever blew <eol> the walk will find some places still and warm <eol> where dead leaves rustle sweet and give alarm <eol> to little birds that flirt and start away <eol>
