devoid of reason , thrall to foolish ire <eol> i walk and chase a savage fairy still <eol> now near the flood , straight on the mounting hill <eol> now midst the woods of youth , and vain desire <eol> for leash i bear a cord of careful grief <eol> for brach i lead an over forward mind <eol> my hounds are thoughts , and rage despairing blind <eol> pain , cruelty , and care without relief <eol> but they perceiving that my swift pursuit <eol> my flying fairy cannot overtake <eol> with open mouths their prey on me do make <eol> like hungry hounds that lately lost their suit <eol> and full of fury on their master feed <eol> to hasten on my hapless death with speed <eol>
