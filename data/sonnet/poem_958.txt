thou in whose all no work imperfect stands <eol> thou who dost gaze on beauty 's unveiled face <eol> grant to thy children thy sustaining grace <eol> when low at length have run the daylight sands <eol> when , though their day was set to thy commands <eol> they bow contritely in prayer 's holy place <eol> because through strivings beauty wards they trace <eol> the sad misshapings of their earthly hands <eol> grant them at eve a soul devoutly still <eol> grant them in dreams a vision of thy light <eol> grant them at morn a sorrow purged away <eol> into the peace of all absolving night <eol> star in the dawnlight of a fairer day <eol> nearer the blossom of thy perfect will <eol>
