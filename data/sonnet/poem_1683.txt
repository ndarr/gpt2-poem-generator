while loftier souls command , nay , make their fate <eol> thy fate made thee and forced thee to be great <eol> yet fortune , who so oft , so blindly sheds <eol> her brightest halo round the weakest heads <eol> found thee undazzled , tranquil as before <eol> proud to be useful , scorning to be more <eol> less moved by glory 's than by duty 's claim <eol> renown the meed , but self applause the aim <eol> all that thou wert reflects less fame on thee <eol> far less , than all thou didst forbear to be <eol> nor yet the patriot of one land alone <eol> for , thine 's a name all nations claim their own <eol> and every shore , where breathed the good and brave <eol> echoed the plaudits thy own country gave <eol>
