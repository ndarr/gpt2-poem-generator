i pray to be the tool which to your hand <eol> long use has shaped and moulded till it be <eol> apt for your need , and , unconsideringly <eol> you take it for its service . i demand <eol> to be forgotten in the woven strand <eol> which grows the multi coloured tapestry <eol> of your bright life , and through its tissues lie <eol> a hidden , strong , sustaining , grey toned band <eol> i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams <eol> the railing to the stairway of the clouds <eol> to guard your steps securely up , where streams <eol> a faery moonshine washing pale the crowds <eol> of pointed stars . remember not whereby <eol> you mount , protected , to the far flung sky <eol>
