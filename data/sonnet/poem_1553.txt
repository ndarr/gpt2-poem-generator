yet there is peace for man .— yea , there is peace <eol> even in this noisy , this unsettled scene <eol> when from the crowd , and from the city far <eol> haply he may be set ( in his late walk <eol> o'ertaken with deep thought ) beneath the boughs <eol> of honeysuckle , when the sun is gone <eol> and with fix 'd eye , and wistful , he surveys <eol> the solemn shadows of the heavens sail <eol> and thinks the season yet shall come , when time <eol> will waft him to repose , to deep repose <eol> far from the unquietness of life — from noise <eol> and tumult far — beyond the flying clouds <eol> beyond the stars , and all this passing scene <eol> where change shall cease , and time shall be no more <eol>
