â€˜ tis best sometimes your censure to restrain <eol> and charitably let the dull be vain <eol> your silence there is better than your spite <eol> for who can rail so long as they can write <eol> still humming on , their drowsy course they keep <eol> and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep <eol> false steps but help them to renew the race <eol> as after stumbling , jades will mend their pace <eol> what crowds of these , impenitently bold <eol> in sounds and jingling syllables grown old <eol> still run on poets in a raging vein <eol> even to the dregs and squeezing of the brain <eol> strain out the last dull droppings of their sense <eol> and rhyme with all the rage of impotence <eol>
