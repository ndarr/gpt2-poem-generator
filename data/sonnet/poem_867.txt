a giant sentinel , alone it stands <eol> on rocky headland where the breakers roar <eol> parted from piny woods and pebbled shore <eol> holding out branches as imploring hands <eol> poor lonely tree , where never bird doth make <eol> its nest , or sing at morn and eve to thee <eol> nor in whose shadow wild rose calleth bee <eol> to come on gauzy wing for love 's sweet sake <eol> nature cares for thee , gives thee sunshine gold <eol> handfuls of pearls cast from the crested waves <eol> for thee pink throated shells soft murmurs hold <eol> and seaweed vested chorists chant in caves <eol> whence came thee , lone one of an alien band <eol> to guard an outpost of this sunset land <eol>
