as islam 's prophet , when his last day drew <eol> nigh to its close , besought all men to say <eol> whom he had wronged , to whom he then should pay <eol> a debt forgotten , or for pardon sue <eol> and , through the silence of his weeping friends <eol> a strange voice cried : “ thou owest me a debt <eol> “ allah be praised ! ” he answered . “ even yet <eol> he gives me power to make to thee amends <eol> o friend ! i thank thee for thy timely word <eol> so runs the tale . its lesson all may heed <eol> for all have sinned in thought , or word , or deed <eol> or , like the prophet , through neglect have erred <eol> all need forgiveness , all have debts to pay <eol> ere the night cometh , while it still is day <eol>
