mary , since first i knew thee , to this hour <eol> my love hath deepened , with my wiser sense <eol> of what in woman is to reverence <eol> thy clear heart , fresh as e'er was forest flower <eol> still opens more to me its beauteous dower <eol> but let praise hush ,â€” love asks no evidence <eol> to prove itself well placed : we know not whence <eol> it gleans the straws that thatch its humble bower <eol> we can but say we found it in the heart <eol> spring of all sweetest thoughts , arch foe of blame <eol> sower of flowers in the dusty mart <eol> pure vestal of the poet 's holy flame <eol> this is enough , and we have done our part <eol> if we but keep it spotless as it came <eol>
