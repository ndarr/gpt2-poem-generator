but you who take the city for your own <eol> come with me when the night flows deep and kind <eol> along these narrow ways of troubled stone <eol> and floods the wide savannas of the mind <eol> with tides that cool the fever of the day <eol> one with the dark , companioned by the stars <eol> we 'll seek st. philip 's , nebulous and gray <eol> holding its throbbing beacon to the bars <eol> a prisoned spirit vibrant in the stone <eol> that knew its empire of forgotten things <eol> then will the city know you for her own <eol> and feel you meet to share her sufferings <eol> while down a swirl of poignant memories <eol> herself shall find you in her silences <eol>
