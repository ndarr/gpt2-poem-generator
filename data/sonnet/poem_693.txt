the light of life has faded from thy cause <eol> high priest of heaven and hell and purgatory <eol> thy lips are loud with strains of oldworld story <eol> but the red prey was rent out of thy paws <eol> long since : and they that dying brake down thy laws <eol> have with the fires of death enkindled glory <eol> put out the flame that faltered on thy hoary <eol> high altars , waning with the world 's applause <eol> this italy was dante 's : bruno died <eol> here : campanella , too sublime for pride <eol> endured thy god 's worst here , and hence went home <eol> and what art thou , that time 's full tide should shrink <eol> for thy sake downward ? what art thou , to think <eol> thy god shall give thee back for birthright rome <eol>
