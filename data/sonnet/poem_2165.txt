i have dreamed of death :â€” what will it be to die <eol> not in a dream , but in the literal truth <eol> with all death 's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth <eol> the pang that is the last and the last sigh <eol> too dulled , it may be , for a last good bye <eol> too comfortless for any one to soothe <eol> a helpless charmless spectacle of ruth <eol> through long last hours , so long while yet they fly <eol> so long to those who hopeless in their fear <eol> watch the slow breath and look for what they dread <eol> while i supine , with ears that cease to hear <eol> with eyes that glaze , with heart pulse running down <eol> ( alas ! no saint rejoicing on her bed <eol> may miss the goal at last , may miss a crown <eol>
