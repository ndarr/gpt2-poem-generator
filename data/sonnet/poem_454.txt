spit in my face , you jews , and pierce my side <eol> buffet and scoff , scourge and crucify me <eol> for i have sinned , and sinned , and only he <eol> who could do no iniquity hath died <eol> but by my death cannot be satisfied <eol> my sins , which pass the jews â€™ impiety <eol> they killed once an inglorious man , but i <eol> crucify him daily , being now glorified <eol> o let me then his strange love still admire <eol> kings pardon , but he bore our punishment <eol> and jacob came , clothed in vile harsh attire <eol> but to supplant , and with gainful intent <eol> god clothed himself in vile man 's flesh , that so <eol> he might be weak enough to surfer woe <eol>
