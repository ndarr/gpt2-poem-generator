pardon , oh , pardon , that my soul should make <eol> of all that strong divineness which i know <eol> for thine and thee , an image only so <eol> formed of the sand , and fit to shift and break <eol> it is that distant years which did not take <eol> thy sovranty , recoiling with a blow <eol> have forced my swimming brain to undergo <eol> their doubt and dread , and blindly to forsake <eol> thy purity of likeness and distort <eol> thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit <eol> as if a shipwrecked pagan , safe in port <eol> his guardian sea god to commemorate <eol> should set a sculptured porpoise , gills a snort <eol> and vibrant tail , within the temple gate <eol>
