like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore <eol> so do our minutes hasten to their end <eol> each changing place with that which goes before <eol> in sequent toil all forwards do contend <eol> nativity once in the main of light <eol> crawls to maturity , wherewith being crowned <eol> crooked eclipses â€˜ gainst his glory fight <eol> and time that gave , doth now his gift confound <eol> time doth transfix the flourish set on youth <eol> and delves the parallels in beauty 's brow <eol> feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth <eol> and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow <eol> and yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand <eol> praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand <eol>
