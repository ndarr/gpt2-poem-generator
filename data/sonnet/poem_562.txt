take all my loves , my love , yea take them all <eol> what hast thou then more than thou hadst before <eol> no love , my love , that thou mayst true love call <eol> all mine was thine , before thou hadst this more <eol> then if for my love , thou my love receivest <eol> i cannot blame thee , for my love thou usest <eol> but yet be blamed , if thou thy self deceivest <eol> by wilful taste of what thy self refusest <eol> i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief <eol> although thou steal thee all my poverty <eol> and yet love knows it is a greater grief <eol> to bear love 's wrong , than hate 's known injury <eol> lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows <eol> kill me with spites yet we must not be foes <eol>
