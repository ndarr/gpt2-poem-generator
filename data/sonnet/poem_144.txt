above this field that shines an eden , lo <eol> that wondrous arch of many married hues <eol> a gorgeous belt , round nature 's lovely waist <eol> sure , earth now seems no place of graves . a wide <eol> gay , blooming paradise ! with moistened face <eol> she smiles , like god , upon this joyous world <eol> a new , wild burst of various harmony <eol> salutes that bow of charm — that orb of glory <eol> thou art the sun and rainbow to my heart <eol> and , as they fade from sight — but do not die <eol> but come to morrow with their wonted charms <eol> thou shalt not die — but gleam o'er me in heaven <eol> with none of all thy beauty , lost or less <eol> can'st thou not sing a song , love , ere it fades <eol>
