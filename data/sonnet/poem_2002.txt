beloved ! if i wander far and oft <eol> from that which i believe , and feel , and know <eol> thou wilt forgive , not with a sorrowing heart <eol> but with a strengthened hope of better things <eol> knowing that i , though often blind and false <eol> to those i love , and oh , more false than all <eol> unto myself , have been most true to thee <eol> and that whoso in one thing hath been true <eol> can be as true in all . therefore thy hope <eol> may yet not prove unfruitful , and thy love <eol> meet , day by day , with less unworthy thanks <eol> whether , as now , we journey hand in hand <eol> or , parted in the body , yet are one <eol> in spirit and the love of holy things <eol>
