lord of my love , to whom in vassalage <eol> thy merit hath my duty strongly knit <eol> to thee i send this written embassage <eol> to witness duty , not to show my wit <eol> duty so great , which wit so poor as mine <eol> may make seem bare , in wanting words to show it <eol> but that i hope some good conceit of thine <eol> in thy soul 's thought ( all naked ) will bestow it <eol> till whatsoever star that guides my moving <eol> points on me graciously with fair aspect <eol> and puts apparel on my tattered loving <eol> to show me worthy of thy sweet respect <eol> then may i dare to boast how i do love thee <eol> till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me <eol>
