i once may see when years shall wreck my wrong <eol> and golden hairs shall change to silver wire <eol> and those bright rays that kindle all this fire <eol> shall fail in force , their working not so strong <eol> then beauty , now the burden of my song <eol> whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire <eol> must yield up all to tyrant time 's desire <eol> then fade those flowers that decked her pride so long <eol> when if she grieve to gaze her in her glass <eol> which then presents her whiter withered hue <eol> go you , my verse , go tell her what she was <eol> for what she was , she best shall find in you <eol> your fiery heat lets not her glory pass <eol> but phoenix like shall make her live anew <eol>
