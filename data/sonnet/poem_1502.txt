shall a man die before his dying day <eol> death ? and for him though the utter day be nigh <eol> not yet , not yet we give him leave to die <eol> we give him grace not yet that men should say <eol> he is dead , wiped out , perished and past away <eol> till the last bitterness of life go by <eol> thou shalt not slay him ; till those last dregs run dry <eol> o thou last lord of life ! thou shalt not slay <eol> let the lips live a little while and lie <eol> the hand a little , and falter , and fail of strength <eol> and the soul shudder and sicken at the sky <eol> yea , let him live , though god nor man would let <eol> save for the curse â€™ sake ; then at bitter length <eol> lord , will we yield him to thee , but not yet <eol>
