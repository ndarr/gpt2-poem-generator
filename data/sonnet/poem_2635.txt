the worldly prince doth in his sceptre hold <eol> a kind of heaven in his authorities <eol> the wealthy miser , in his mass of gold <eol> makes to his soul a kind of paradise <eol> the epicure that eats and drinks all day <eol> accounts no heaven , but in his hellish routs <eol> and she , whose beauty seems a sunny day <eol> makes up her heaven but in her baby 's clouts <eol> but , my sweet god , i seek no prince 's power <eol> no miser 's wealth , nor beauty 's fading gloss <eol> which pamper sin , whose sweets are inward sour <eol> and sorry gains that breed the spirit 's loss <eol> no , my dear lord , let my heaven only be <eol> in my love 's service , but to live to thee <eol>
