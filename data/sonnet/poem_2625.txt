great soul , thou sittest with me in my room <eol> uplifting me with thy vast , quiet eyes <eol> on whose full orbs , with kindly lustre , lies <eol> the twilight warmth of ruddy ember gloom <eol> thy clear , strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom <eol> of hope secure , to him who lonely cries <eol> wrestling with the young poet 's agonies <eol> neglect and scorn , which seem a certain doom <eol> yes ! the few words which , like great thunder drops <eol> thy large heart down to earth shook doubtfully <eol> thrilled by the inward lightning of its might <eol> serene and pure , like gushing joy of light <eol> shall track the eternal chords of destiny <eol> after the moon led pulse of ocean stops <eol>
