nymph of the downward smile , and sidelong glance <eol> in what diviner moments of the day <eol> art thou most lovely ? when gone far astray <eol> into the labyrinths of sweet utterance <eol> or when serenely wand'ring in a trance <eol> of sober thought ? or when starting away <eol> with careless robe , to meet the morning ray <eol> thou spar'st the flowers in thy mazy dance <eol> haply â€˜ tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly <eol> and so remain , because thou listenest <eol> but thou to please wert nurtured so completely <eol> that i can never tell what mood is best <eol> i shall as soon pronounce which grace more neatly <eol> trips it before apollo than the rest <eol>
