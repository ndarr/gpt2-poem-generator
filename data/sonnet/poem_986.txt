above the ruin of god 's holy place <eol> where man forsaken lay the bleeding rood <eol> whose hands , when men had craved substantial food <eol> gave not , nor folded when they cried , embrace <eol> i saw exalted in the latter days <eol> her whom west winds with natal foam bedewed <eol> wafted toward cyprus , lily breasted , nude <eol> standing with arms out stretched and flower like face <eol> and , sick with all those centuries of tears <eol> shed in the penance for factitious woe <eol> once more i saw the nations at her feet <eol> for love shone in their eyes , and in their ears <eol> come unto me , love beckoned them , for lo <eol> the breast your lips abjured is still as sweet <eol>
