i love to see the old heath 's withered brake <eol> mingle its crimpled leaves with furze and ling <eol> while the old heron from the lonely lake <eol> starts slow and flaps his melancholy wing <eol> and oddling crow in idle motions swing <eol> on the half rotten ashtree 's topmost twig <eol> beside whose trunk the gipsy makes his bed <eol> up flies the bouncing woodcock from the brig <eol> where a black quagmire quakes beneath the tread <eol> the fieldfares chatter in the whistling thorn <eol> and for the awe round fields and closen rove <eol> and coy bumbarrels twenty in a drove <eol> flit down the hedgerows in the frozen plain <eol> and hang on little twigs and start again <eol>
