you say that love then led us — you and me <eol> i say ‘ twas hate , that wore love 's wanting eyes <eol> hate that i could not tear away the lies <eol> that wrapped you with their silken sorcery <eol> hate that for you i could not open skies <eol> where beauty lives of her own loveliness <eol> that god would give me no omnipotence <eol> to purge and mould anew your soul 's numb sense <eol> aye , hate that i could love you not tho love <eol> pent in me ached with passion born distress <eol> while thro unfathomable dark the prize <eol> seemed sinking , as my soul , from heaven above <eol> love , say you ? love ? and hate rent us apart <eol> i tell you hate alone so tears the heart <eol>
