the wide , bright temple of the world i found <eol> and entered from the dizzy infinite <eol> that i might kneel and worship thee in it <eol> leaving the singing stars their ceaseless round <eol> of silver music sound on orbed sound <eol> for measured spaces where the shrines are lit <eol> and men with wisdom or with little wit <eol> implore the gods that mercy may abound <eol> ah , aphrodite , was it not from thee <eol> my summons came across the endless spaces <eol> mother of love , turn not thy face from me <eol> now that i seek for thee in human faces <eol> answer my prayer or set my spirit free <eol> again to drift along the starry places <eol>
