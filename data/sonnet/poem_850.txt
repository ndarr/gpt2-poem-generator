when thou shalt be disposed to set me light <eol> and place my merit in the eye of scorn <eol> upon thy side , against my self i 'll fight <eol> and prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn <eol> with mine own weakness being best acquainted <eol> upon thy part i can set down a story <eol> of faults concealed , wherein i am attainted <eol> that thou in losing me , shalt win much glory <eol> and i by this will be a gainer too <eol> for bending all my loving thoughts on thee <eol> the injuries that to my self i do <eol> doing thee vantage , double vantage me <eol> such is my love , to thee i so belong <eol> that for thy right , my self will bear all wrong <eol>
