shall i compare thee to a summer 's day <eol> thou art more lovely and more temperate <eol> rough winds do shake the darling buds of may <eol> and summer 's lease hath all too short a date <eol> sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines <eol> and often is his gold complexion dimmed <eol> and every fair from fair sometime declines <eol> by chance , or nature 's changing course untrimmed <eol> but thy eternal summer shall not fade <eol> nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st <eol> nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade <eol> when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st <eol> so long as men can breathe or eyes can see <eol> so long lives this , and this gives life to thee <eol>
