sweet bird , that sing'st away the early hours <eol> of winters past or coming , void of care <eol> well pleased with delights which present are <eol> fair seasons , budding sprays , sweet smelling flowers <eol> to rocks , to springs , to rills , from leafy bowers <eol> thou thy creator 's goodness dost declare <eol> and what dear gifts on thee he did not spare <eol> a stain to human sense in sin that lowers <eol> what soul can be so sick , which by thy songs <eol> attired in sweetness , sweetly is not driven <eol> quite to forget earth 's turmoils , spites , and wrongs <eol> and lift a reverend eye and thought to heaven <eol> sweet artless songster , thou my mind dost raise <eol> to airs of spheres , yes , and to angels â€™ lays <eol>
