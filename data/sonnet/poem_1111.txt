friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear <eol> than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek <eol> burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year <eol> lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak <eol> thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near <eol> close on thy footsteps â€˜ mid the landscape drear <eol> i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek <eol> warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak <eol> look backward ! from thy lofty height survey <eol> thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won <eol> of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun <eol> look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray <eol> streams the pure light of heaven 's unsetting sun <eol> the unclouded dawn of life 's immortal day <eol>
