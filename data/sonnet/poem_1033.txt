upon the steps a woman stands â€” alone <eol> her lovely face , a trifle paler grown <eol> since last we looked upon its haunting grace <eol> yet still the same child mouth , the radiant eyes <eol> the dauntless pride , that time cannot efface <eol> before her gazes the earth in beauty lies <eol> awhile she stands and gaze on the scene <eol> with dreamy , far off looks and thoughtful mien <eol> then wends her way to where the flowers lie <eol> she lingers here , she cannot pass them by <eol> and as she bends to touch each smiling flower <eol> her hands seem gifted with a magic power <eol> that draws unto herself their clinging love <eol> as human tendrils drawn to god above <eol>
