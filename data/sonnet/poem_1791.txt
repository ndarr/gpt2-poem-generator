ah me ! the fifty years since last we met <eol> seem to me fifty folios bound and set <eol> by time , the great transcriber , on his shelves <eol> wherein are written the histories of ourselves <eol> what tragedies , what comedies , are there <eol> what joy and grief , what rapture and despair <eol> what chronicles of triumph and defeat <eol> of struggle , and temptation , and retreat <eol> what records of regrets , and doubts , and fears <eol> what pages blotted , blistered by our tears <eol> what lovely landscapes on the margin shine <eol> what sweet , angelic faces , what divine <eol> and holy images of love and trust <eol> undimmed by age , unsoiled by damp or dust <eol>
