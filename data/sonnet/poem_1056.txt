surprised by joy — impatient as the wind <eol> i turned to share the transport — oh ! with whom <eol> but thee , deep buried in the silent tomb <eol> that spot which no vicissitude can find <eol> love , faithful love , recalled thee to my mind <eol> but how could i forget thee ? through what power <eol> even for the least division of an hour <eol> have i been so beguiled as to be blind <eol> to my most grievous loss ?— that thought 's return <eol> was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore <eol> save one , one only , when i stood forlorn <eol> knowing my heart 's best treasure was no more <eol> that neither present time , nor years unborn <eol> could to my sight that heavenly face restore <eol>
