since there is no escape , since at the end <eol> my body will be utterly destroyed <eol> this hand i love as i have loved a friend <eol> this body i tended , wept with and enjoyed <eol> since there is no escape even for me <eol> who love life with a love too sharp to bear <eol> the scent of orchards in the rain , the sea <eol> and hours alone too still and sure for prayer <eol> since darkness waits for me , then all the more <eol> let me go down as waves sweep to the shore <eol> in pride ; and let me sing with my last breath <eol> in these few hours of light i lift my head <eol> life is my lover â€” i shall leave the dead <eol> if there is any way to baffle death <eol>
