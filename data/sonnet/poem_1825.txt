dear ! of all happy in the hour , most blest <eol> he who has found our hid security <eol> assured in the dark tides of the world that rest <eol> and heard our word , â€˜ who is so safe as we <eol> we have found safety with all things undying <eol> the winds , and morning , tears of men and mirth <eol> the deep night , and birds singing , and clouds flying <eol> and sleep , and freedom , and the autumnal earth <eol> we have built a house that is not for time 's throwing <eol> we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever <eol> war knows no power . safe shall be my going <eol> secretly armed against all death 's endeavour <eol> safe though all safety 's lost ; safe where men fall <eol> and if these poor limbs die , safest of all <eol>
