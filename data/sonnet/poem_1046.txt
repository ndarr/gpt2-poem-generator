the eye was shut in men ; the hearing ear <eol> dull unto deafness ; nought but earthly things <eol> had credence ; and no highest art that flings <eol> a spirit radiance from it , like the spear <eol> of the ice pointed mountain , lifted clear <eol> in the nigh sunrise , had made skyey springs <eol> of light in the clouds of dull imaginings <eol> vain were the painter or the sculptor here <eol> give man the listening heart , the seeing eye <eol> give life ; let sea derived fountain well <eol> within his spirit , infant waves , to tell <eol> of the far ocean mysteries that lie <eol> silent upon the horizon ,â€” evermore <eol> falling in voices on the human shore <eol>
