in wiser days , my darling rosebud , blown <eol> to beauty proud as was your mother 's prime <eol> in that desired , delayed , incredible time <eol> you 'll ask why i abandoned you , my own <eol> and the dear heart that was your baby throne <eol> to dice with death . and oh ! they 'll give you rhyme <eol> and reason : some will call the thing sublime <eol> and some decry it in a knowing tone <eol> so here , while the mad guns curse overhead <eol> and tired men sigh with mud for couch and floor <eol> know that we fools , now with the foolish dead <eol> died not for flag , nor king , nor emperor <eol> but for a dream , born in a herdsman 's shed <eol> and for the secret scripture of the poor <eol>
