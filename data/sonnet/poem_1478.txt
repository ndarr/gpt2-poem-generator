the world is too much with us ; late and soon <eol> getting and spending , we lay waste our powers <eol> little we see in nature that is ours <eol> we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon <eol> this sea that bares her bosom to the moon <eol> the winds that will be howling at all hours <eol> and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers <eol> for this , for everything , we are out of tune <eol> it moves us not .â€” great god ! i 'd rather be <eol> a pagan suckled in a creed outworn <eol> so might i , standing on this pleasant lea <eol> have glimpses that would make me less forlorn <eol> have sight of proteus rising from the sea <eol> or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn <eol>
