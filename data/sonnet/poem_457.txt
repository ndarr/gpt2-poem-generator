like memnon 's rock , touched with the rising sun <eol> which yields a sound and echoes forth a voice <eol> but when it 's drowned in western seas is done <eol> and drowsy like leaves off to make a noise <eol> so i , my love , enlightened with your shine <eol> a poet 's skill within my soul i shroud <eol> not rude like that which finer wits decline <eol> but such as muses to the best allowed <eol> but when your figure and your shape is gone <eol> i speechless am like as i was before <eol> or if i write , my verse is filled with moan <eol> and blurred with tears by falling in such store <eol> then muse not , licia , if my muse be slack <eol> for when i wrote i did thy beauty lack <eol>
