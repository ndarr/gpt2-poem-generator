maids shout to breakfast in a merry strife <eol> and the cat runs to hear the whetted knife <eol> and dogs are ever in the way to watch <eol> the mouldy crust and falling bone to catch <eol> the wooden dishes round in haste are set <eol> and round the table all the boys are met <eol> all know their own save hodge who would be first <eol> but every one his master leaves the worst <eol> on every wooden dish , a humble claim <eol> two rude cut letters mark the owner 's name <eol> from every nook the smile of plenty calls <eol> and rusty flitches decorate the walls <eol> moore 's almanack where wonders never cease <eol> all smeared with candle snuff and bacon grease <eol>
