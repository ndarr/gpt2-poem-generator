maiden , when such a soul as thine is born <eol> the morning stars their ancient music make <eol> and , joyful , once again their song awake <eol> long silent now with melancholy scorn <eol> and thou , not mindless of so blest a morn <eol> by no least deed its harmony shalt break <eol> but shalt to that high chime thy footsteps take <eol> through life 's most darksome passes unforlorn <eol> therefore from thy pure faith thou shalt not fall <eol> therefore shalt thou be ever fair and free <eol> and in thine every motion musical <eol> as summer air , majestic as the sea <eol> a mystery to those who creep and crawl <eol> through time , and part it from eternity <eol>
