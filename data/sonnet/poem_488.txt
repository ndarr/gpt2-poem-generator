go from me . yet i feel that i shall stand <eol> henceforward in thy shadow . nevermore <eol> alone upon the threshold of my door <eol> of individual life , i shall command <eol> the uses of my soul , nor lift my hand <eol> serenely in the sunshine as before <eol> without the sense of that which i forbore <eol> thy touch upon the palm . the widest land <eol> doom takes to part us , leaves thy heart in mine <eol> with pulses that beat double . what i do <eol> and what i dream include thee , as the wine <eol> must taste of its own grapes . and when i sue <eol> god for myself , he hears that name of thine <eol> and sees within my eyes the tears of two <eol>
