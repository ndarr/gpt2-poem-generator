again i follow it , throughout the day <eol> with anxious eyes i see it trip and fall <eol> and hurt itself in many a foolish way <eol> childlike , unheeding warning word or call <eol> i see it grasp , and grasping , break the toys <eol> it cried to own , then toss them on the floor <eol> and , breathless , hurry after fancied joys <eol> that cease to please , when added to its store <eol> i see the lacerations on its hands <eol> made by forbidden tools ; but when it weeps <eol> i also weep , as one who understands <eol> and having been a child , the memory keeps <eol> ah , my poor world , however wrong thy part <eol> still is there pity in my mother heart <eol>
