father , part of his double interest <eol> unto thy kingdom thy son gives to me <eol> his jointure in the knotty trinity <eol> he keeps , and gives to me his death 's conquest <eol> this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest <eol> was from the world 's beginning slain , and he <eol> hath made two wills , which , with the legacy <eol> of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest <eol> yet such are these laws , that men argue yet <eol> whether a man those statutes can fulfil <eol> none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit <eol> revive again what law and letter kill <eol> thy law 's abridgment and thy last command <eol> is all but love ; oh , let this last will stand <eol>
