oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags <eol> that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags <eol> grant us one moment to unloose the strings <eol> while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings <eol> but what a heap of motley trash appears <eol> crammed in the bundles of successive years <eol> as the lost rustic on some festal day <eol> stares through the concourse in its vast array <eol> where in one cake a throng of faces runs <eol> all stuck together like a sheet of buns <eol> and throws the bait of some unheeded name <eol> or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim <eol> so roams my vision , wandering over all <eol> and strives to choose , but knows not where to fall <eol>
