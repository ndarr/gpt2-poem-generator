they could not take the living god away <eol> although they left his altar blank and bare <eol> their ruthless hands could never rend and tear <eol> more than the walls , they could not hope to sway <eol> the utter faith that is the nation 's heart <eol> they could not bring a real destruction where <eol> hymn music had been softly wont to play <eol> they smothered beauty , and tore hope apart <eol> but in the house of one who is supreme <eol> the marks they left will now be sanctified <eol> the broken walls , when war is but a dream <eol> will be a monument to those who died <eol> and every shell torn scar will stand for one <eol> whose hands were scarred , the christ men crucified <eol>
