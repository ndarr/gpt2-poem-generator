â€˜ tis holy ground ! the silent silver lights <eol> and darks undreamed of , falling year by year <eol> upon his sleep , in soft australian nights <eol> are joys enough for him who lieth here <eol> so sanctified with rest . we need not rear <eol> the storied monument o'er such a spot <eol> that soul , the first for whom the christian tear <eol> was shed on austral soil , hath heritage <eol> most ample ! let the ages wane with age <eol> the grass which clothes this grave shall wither not <eol> see yonder quiet lily ! have the blights <eol> of many winters left it on a faded tomb <eol> oh , peace ! its fellows , glad with green delights <eol> shall gather round it deep eternal bloom <eol>
