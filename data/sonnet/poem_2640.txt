when winds that move not its calm surface sweep <eol> the azure sea , i love the land no more <eol> the smiles of the serene and tranquil deep <eol> tempt my unquiet mind .— but when the roar <eol> of ocean 's gray abyss resounds , and foam <eol> gathers upon the sea , and vast waves burst <eol> i turn from the drear aspect to the home <eol> of earth and its deep woods , where , interspersed <eol> when winds blow loud , pines make sweet melody <eol> whose house is some lone bark , whose toil the sea <eol> whose prey the wandering fish , an evil lot <eol> has chosen .— but i my languid limbs will fling <eol> beneath the plane , where the brook 's murmuring <eol> moves the calm spirit , but disturbs it not <eol>
