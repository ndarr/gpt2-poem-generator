fair amaryllis , wilt thou never peep <eol> from forth the cave , and call me , and be mine <eol> lo , apples ten i bear thee from the steep <eol> these didst thou long for , and all these are thine <eol> ah , would i were a honey bee to sweep <eol> through ivy , and the bracken , and woodbine <eol> to watch thee waken , love , and watch thee sleep <eol> within thy grot below the shadowy pine <eol> now know i love , a cruel god is he <eol> the wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear <eol> and truly to the bone he burneth me <eol> but , black browed amaryllis , ne'er a tear <eol> nor sigh , nor blush , nor aught have i from thee <eol> nay , nor a kiss , a little gift and dear <eol>
