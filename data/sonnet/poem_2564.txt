that you were once unkind befriends me now <eol> and for that sorrow , which i then did feel <eol> needs must i under my transgression bow <eol> unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel <eol> for if you were by my unkindness shaken <eol> as i by yours , y'have passed a hell of time <eol> and i a tyrant have no leisure taken <eol> to weigh how once i suffered in your crime <eol> o that our night of woe might have remembered <eol> my deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits <eol> and soon to you , as you to me then tendered <eol> the humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits <eol> but that your trespass now becomes a fee <eol> mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me <eol>
