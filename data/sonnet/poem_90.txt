ah ! changed and cold , how changed and very cold <eol> with stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes <eol> changed , yet the same ; much knowing , little wise <eol> this was the promise of the days of old <eol> grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould <eol> grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies <eol> we hoped for better things as years would rise <eol> but it is over as a tale once told <eol> all fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore <eol> all lost the present and the future time <eol> all lost , all lost , the lapse that went before <eol> so lost till death shut to the opened door <eol> so lost from chime to everlasting chime <eol> so cold and lost for ever evermore <eol>
