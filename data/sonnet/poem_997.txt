for if alone thou think to waft my love <eol> her cold is such as can the sea command <eol> and frozen ice shall let thy boat to move <eol> nor can thy forces row it from the land <eol> but if thou friendly both at once shalt take <eol> thyself mayst rest . for why ? my sighs will blow <eol> our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make <eol> as that thy boat without thy help shall row <eol> then will i sit and glut me on those eyes <eol> wherewith my life my eyes could never fill <eol> thus from my boat that comfort shall arise <eol> the want whereof my life and hope did kill <eol> together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross <eol> where if we part thy boat must suffer loss <eol>
