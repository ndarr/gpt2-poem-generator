lyre of the sonnet , that full many a time <eol> amus 'd my lassitude , and sooth 'd my pains <eol> when graver cares forbade the lengthen 'd strains <eol> to thy brief bound , and oft returning chime <eol> a long farewell !— the splendid forms of rhyme <eol> when grief in lonely orphanism reigns <eol> oppress the drooping soul .— death 's dark domains <eol> throw mournful shadows o'er the aonian clime <eol> for in their silent bourne my filial bands <eol> lie all dissolv 'd ;— and swiftly wasting pour <eol> from my frail glass of life , health 's sparkling sands <eol> sleep then , my lyre , thy tuneful tasks are o'er <eol> sleep ! for my heart bereav 'd , and listless hands <eol> wake with rapt touch thy glowing strings no more <eol>
