mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled <eol> thy beauty 's form in table of my heart <eol> my body is the frame wherein â€˜ tis held <eol> and perspective it is best painter 's art <eol> for through the painter must you see his skill <eol> to find where your true image pictured lies <eol> which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still <eol> that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes <eol> now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done <eol> mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me <eol> are windows to my breast , where through the sun <eol> delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee <eol> yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art <eol> they draw but what they see , know not the heart <eol>
