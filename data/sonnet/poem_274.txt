me my own fate to lasting sorrow doometh <eol> thy woes are birds of passage , transitory <eol> thy spirit , circled with a living glory <eol> in summer still a summer joy resumeth <eol> alone my hopeless melancholy gloometh <eol> like a lone cypress , through the twilight hoary <eol> from an old garden where no flower bloometh <eol> one cypress on an inland promontory <eol> but yet my lonely spirit follows thine <eol> as round the rolling earth night follows day <eol> but yet thy lights on my horizon shine <eol> into my night when thou art far away <eol> i am so dark , alas ! and thou so bright <eol> when we two meet there 's never perfect light <eol>
