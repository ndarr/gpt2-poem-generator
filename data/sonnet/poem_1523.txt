methinks i see thee , lying calm and low <eol> silent and dark within thy earthy bed <eol> thy mighty hands , in which i trusted , dead <eol> resting , with thy long arms , from work or blow <eol> and the night robe , around thy tall form , flow <eol> down from the kingly face , and from the head <eol> save by its thick dark curls , uncovered <eol> my brother , dear from childhood , lying so <eol> not often since thou went'st , i think of thee <eol> ( with inward cares and questionings oppressed <eol> and yet , ere long , i seek thee in thy rest <eol> and bring thee home my heart , as full , as free <eol> as sure that thou wilt take me tenderly <eol> as then when youth and nature made us blest <eol>
