from records true my legends i rehearse <eol> and string the pearls of wisdom in my verse <eol> that in the glimmering days of life 's decline <eol> its fruits , in wealth and honor , may be mine <eol> my verse , a structure pointing to the skies <eol> whose solid strength destroying time defies <eol> all praise the noble work , save only those <eol> of impious life , or base malignant foes <eol> all blest with learning read , and read again <eol> the sovereign smiles , and thus approves my strain <eol> â€œ richer by far , firdusi , than a mine <eol> of precious gems , is this bright lay of thine <eol> centuries may pass away , but still my page <eol> will be the boast of each succeeding age <eol>
