are those two stars , her eyes , my life 's light gone <eol> by which my soul was fre Ã¨ d from all dark <eol> and am i left distressed to live alone <eol> where none my tears and mournful tale shall mark <eol> ah sun , why shine thy looks , thy looks like gold <eol> when horsemen brave thou risest in the east <eol> ah cynthia pale , to whom my griefs i told <eol> why do you both rejoice both man and beast <eol> and i alone , alone that dark possess <eol> by licia 's absence brighter than the sun <eol> whose smiling light did ease my sad distress <eol> and broke the clouds , when tears like rain begun <eol> heavens , grant that light and so me waking keep <eol> or shut my eyes and rock me fast asleep <eol>
