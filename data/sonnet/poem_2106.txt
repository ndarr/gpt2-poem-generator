if in the summer of thy bright regard <eol> for one brief season these poor rhymes shall live <eol> i ask no more , nor think my fate too hard <eol> if other eyes but wintry looks should give <eol> nor will i grieve though what i here have writ <eol> o'erburdened time should drop among the ways <eol> and to the unremembering dust commit <eol> beyond the praise and blame of other days <eol> the song doth pass , but i who sing , remain <eol> i pluck from death 's own heart a life more deep <eol> and as the spring , that dies not , in her train <eol> doth scatter blossoms for the winds to reap <eol> so i , immortal , as i fare along <eol> will strew my path with mortal flowers of song <eol>
