to stab my youth with desperate knives , to wear <eol> this paltry age 's gaudy livery <eol> to let each base hand filch my treasury <eol> to mesh my soul within a woman 's hair <eol> and be mere fortune 's lackeyed groom ,â€” i swear <eol> i love it not ! these things are less to me <eol> than the thin foam that frets upon the sea <eol> less than the thistledown of summer air <eol> which hath no seed : better to stand aloof <eol> far from these slanderous fools who mock my life <eol> knowing me not , better the lowliest roof <eol> fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in <eol> than to go back to that hoarse cave of strife <eol> where my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin <eol>
