the tide is rippling to my very feet <eol> the mountains are before me , and around <eol> stretching in misty grandeur till they meet <eol> in one dim bourne , their hoary summits crown 'd <eol> with cloudy chaplets , such as might have bound <eol> the new born thunderer when saturn fell <eol> all wonder stricken , from his mighty throne <eol> the sun is shining upon wooded slopes <eol> and distant headlands , with faint shadows thrown <eol> amid its brightness like the shatter 'd hopes <eol> of a young noontide , and its golden light <eol> crests the upheaving waters till each swell <eol> is tremulous with glory , and the sight <eol> pictures strange fancies which no tongue can tell <eol>
