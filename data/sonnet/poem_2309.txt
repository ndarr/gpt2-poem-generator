i grant thou wert not married to my muse <eol> and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook <eol> the dedicated words which writers use <eol> of their fair subject , blessing every book <eol> thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue <eol> finding thy worth a limit past my praise <eol> and therefore art enforced to seek anew <eol> some fresher stamp of the time bettering days <eol> and do so love , yet when they have devised <eol> what strained touches rhetoric can lend <eol> thou truly fair , wert truly sympathized <eol> in true plain words , by thy true telling friend <eol> and their gross painting might be better used <eol> where cheeks need blood , in thee it is abused <eol>
