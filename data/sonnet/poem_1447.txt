beloved , in the noisy city here <eol> the thought of thee can make all turmoil cease <eol> around my spirit , folds thy spirit clear <eol> its still , soft arms , and circles it with peace <eol> there is no room for any doubt or fear <eol> in souls so overfilled with love 's increase <eol> there is no memory of the bygone year <eol> but growth in heart 's and spirit 's perfect ease <eol> how hath our love , half nebulous at first <eol> rounded itself into a full orbed sun <eol> how have our lives and wills ( as haply erst <eol> they were , ere this forgetfulness begun <eol> through all their earthly distances outburst <eol> and melted , like two rays of light in one <eol>
