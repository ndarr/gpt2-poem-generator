rare is the loveliness of slow decay <eol> with youth and beauty all must be desired <eol> but â€˜ tis the charm of things long past away <eol> they leave , alone , the light they have inspired <eol> the calmness of a picture ; memory now <eol> is the sole life among the ruins grey <eol> and like a phantom in fantastic play <eol> she wanders with rank weeds stuck on her brow <eol> over grass hidden caves and turret tops <eol> herself almost as tottering as they <eol> while , to the steps of time , her latest props <eol> fall stone by stone , and in the sun 's hot ray <eol> all that remains stands up in rugged pride <eol> and bridal vines drink in his juices on each side <eol>
