tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er <eol> smooth lovely ocean . through the lustrous gloom <eol> a savor steals from linden trees in bloom <eol> and gardens ranged at many a palace door <eol> proud walls rise here , and , where the moonbeams pour <eol> their pale enchantment down the dim coast line <eol> terrace and lawn , trim hedge and flowering vine <eol> crown with fair culture all the sounding shore <eol> how sweet , to such a place , on such a night <eol> from halls with beauty and festival a glare <eol> to come distract and , stretched on the cool turf <eol> yield to some fond , improbable delight <eol> while the moon , reddening , sinks , and all the air <eol> sighs with the muffled tumult of the surf <eol>
