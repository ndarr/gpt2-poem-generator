upon a rock i sat — a mountain side <eol> far , far forsaken of the old sea 's lip <eol> a rock where ancient waters ’ rise and dip <eol> recoil and plunge , eddy , and oscillant tide <eol> had worn and worn , while races lived and died <eol> involved channels . where the sea weed 's drip <eol> followed the ebb , now crumbling lichens sip <eol> sparse dews of heaven that down with sunset slide <eol> i sat long gazing southward . a dry flow <eol> of withering wind sucked up my drooping strength <eol> itself weak from the desert 's burning length <eol> behind me piled , away and up did go <eol> great sweeps of savage mountains — up , away <eol> where snow gleams ever , panthers roam , they say <eol>
