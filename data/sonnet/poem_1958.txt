dares he behold the thing he is , what thing <eol> he would become is in his mind its child <eol> astir , demanding birth to light and wing <eol> for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled <eol> so moves he forth in faith , if he has made <eol> his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth <eol> earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid <eol> he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth <eol> then knows he love , that beckons and controls <eol> the star of sky upon his footway cast <eol> then match in him who holds his tempters fast <eol> the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's <eol> then earth her man for woman finds at last <eol> to speed the pair unto her goal of goals <eol>
