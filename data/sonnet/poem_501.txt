they pass me by like shadows , crowds on crowds <eol> dim ghosts of men , that hover to and fro <eol> hugging their bodies round them like thin shrouds <eol> wherein their souls were buried long ago <eol> they trampled on their youth , and faith , and love <eol> they cast their hope of human kind away <eol> with heaven 's clear messages they madly strove <eol> and conquered ,— and their spirits turned to clay <eol> lo ! how they wander round the world , their grave <eol> whose ever gaping maw by such is fed <eol> gibbering at living men , and idly rave <eol> ‘ we only truly live , but ye are dead <eol> alas ! poor fools , the anointed eye may trace <eol> a dead soul 's epitaph in every face <eol>
