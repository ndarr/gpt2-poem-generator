insect or blossom ? fragile , fairy thing <eol> poised upon slender tip , and quivering <eol> to flight ! a flower of the fields of air <eol> a jeweled moth ; a butterfly , with rare <eol> and tender tints upon his downy wings <eol> a moment resting in our happy sight <eol> a flower held captive by a thread so slight <eol> its petal wings of broidered gossamer <eol> are light as the wind , with every wind astir <eol> wafting sweet odor , faint and exquisite <eol> o dainty nursling of the field and sky <eol> what fairer thing looks up to heaven 's blue <eol> and drinks the noontide sun , the dawning 's dew <eol> thou winged bloom ! thou blossom butterfly <eol>
