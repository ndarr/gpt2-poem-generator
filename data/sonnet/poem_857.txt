night is the true democracy . when day <eol> like some great monarch with his train has passed <eol> in regal pomp and splendor to the last <eol> the stars troop forth along the milky way <eol> a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray <eol> on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast <eol> and things of earth , the hunted and outcast <eol> come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea <eol> even from the nooks and crannies of the mind <eol> visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start <eol> and specters of dead joy , that shun the light <eol> and impotent regrets and terrors blind <eol> each one , in form grotesque , playing its part <eol> in the fantastic mardi gras of night <eol>
