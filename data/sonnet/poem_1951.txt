the silvery dimness of a happy dream <eol> i 've known of late . methought where byron moans <eol> like some wild gulf in melancholy zones <eol> i passed tear blinded . once a lurid gleam <eol> of stormy sunset loitered on the sea <eol> while , travelling troubled like a straitened stream <eol> the voice of shelley died away from me <eol> still sore at heart , i reached a lake lit lea <eol> and then the green mossed glades with many a grove <eol> where lies the calm which wordsworth used to love <eol> and , lastly , locksley hall , from whence did rise <eol> a haunting song that blew and breathed and blew <eol> with rare delights . â€˜ twas there i woke and knew <eol> the sumptuous comfort left in drowsy eyes <eol>
