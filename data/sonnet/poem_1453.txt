land of our fathers , in thine hour of need <eol> god help thee , guarded by the passive creed <eol> as the lone pilgrim trusts to beads and cowl <eol> when through the forest rings the gray wolf 's howl <eol> as the deep galleon trusts her gilded prow <eol> when the black corsair slants athwart her bow <eol> as the poor pheasant , with his peaceful mien <eol> trusts to his feathers , shining golden green <eol> when the dark plumage with the crimson beak <eol> has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak <eol> so trust thy friends , whose babbling tongues would charm <eol> the lifted sabre from thy foeman 's arm <eol> thy torches ready for the answering peal <eol> from bellowing fort and thunder freighted keel <eol>
