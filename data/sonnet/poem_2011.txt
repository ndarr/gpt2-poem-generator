guido , i would that lapo , thou , and i <eol> led by some strong enchantment , might ascend <eol> a magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly <eol> with winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend <eol> so that no change , nor any evil chance <eol> should mar our joyous voyage ; but it might be <eol> that even satiety should still enhance <eol> between our hearts their strict community <eol> and that the bounteous wizard then would place <eol> vanna and bice and my gentle love <eol> companions of our wandering , and would grace <eol> with passionate talk , wherever we might rove <eol> our time , and each were as content and free <eol> as i believe that thou and i should be <eol>
