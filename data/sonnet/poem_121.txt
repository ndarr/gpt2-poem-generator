far yonder , where orchards and gardens lie <eol> and dwellings cluster , ‘ tis there men die <eol> they are born , they die , and are buried near <eol> where the populous grave yard lightens the bier <eol> for strict and close are the ties that bind <eol> in death the children of human kind <eol> yea , stricter and closer than those of life <eol> ‘ tis a neighbourhood that knows no strife <eol> they are noiselessly gathered — friend and foe <eol> to the still and dark assemblies below <eol> without a frown or a smile they meet <eol> each pale and calm in his winding sheet <eol> in that sullen home of peace and gloom <eol> crowded , like guests in a banquet room <eol>
