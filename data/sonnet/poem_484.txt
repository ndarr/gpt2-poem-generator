by night close bolted in the bagnio 's gloom <eol> think how they ponder on their dreadful doom <eol> recal the tender sire , the weeping bride <eol> the home , far sunder 'd by a waste of tide <eol> brood all the ties that once endear 'd them there <eol> but now , strung stronger , edge their keen despair <eol> till here a fouler fiend arrests their pace <eol> plague , with his burning breath and bloated face <eol> with saffron eyes that thro the dungeon shine <eol> and the black tumors bursting from the groin <eol> stalks o'er the slave ; who , cowering on the sod <eol> shrinks from the demon and invokes his god <eol> sucks hot contagion with his quivering breath <eol> and , rack 'd with rending torture , sinks in death <eol>
