when to the garden of untroubled thought <eol> i came of late , and saw the open door <eol> and wished again to enter , and explore <eol> the sweet , wild ways with stainless bloom inwrought <eol> and bowers of innocence with beauty fraught <eol> it seemed some purer voice must speak before <eol> i dared to tread that garden loved of yore <eol> that eden lost unknown and found unsought <eol> then just within the gate i saw a child <eol> a stranger child , yet to my heart most dear <eol> who held his hands to me and softly smiled <eol> with eyes that knew no shade of sin or fear <eol> “ come in , ” he said , “ and play awhile with me <eol> i am the little child you used to be <eol>
