vain transitory splendours could not all <eol> reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall <eol> obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart <eol> an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart <eol> thither no more the peasant shall repair <eol> to sweet oblivion of his daily care <eol> no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale <eol> no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail <eol> no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear <eol> relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear <eol> the host himself no longer shall be found <eol> careful to see the mantling bliss go round <eol> nor the coy maid , half willing to be pressed <eol> shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest <eol>
