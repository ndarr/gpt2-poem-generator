god 's child in christ adopted ,— christ my all <eol> what that earth boasts were not lost cheaply , rather <eol> than forfeit that blest name , by which i call <eol> the holy one , the almighty god , my father <eol> father ! in christ we live , and christ in thee <eol> eternal thou , and everlasting we <eol> the heir of heaven , henceforth i fear not death <eol> in christ i live ! in christ i draw the breath <eol> of the true life !— let then earth , sea , and sky <eol> make war against me ! on my heart i show <eol> their mighty master 's seal . in vain they try <eol> to end my life , that can but end its woe <eol> is that a death bed where a christian lies <eol> yes ! but not his — ‘ tis death itself there dies <eol>
