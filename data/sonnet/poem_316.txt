i went to listen to my teacher friend <eol> o friend above , thanks for the friend below <eol> who having been made wise , deep things to know <eol> with brooding spirit over them doth bend <eol> until they waken words , as wings , to send <eol> their seeds far forth , seeking a place to grow <eol> the lesson past , with quiet foot i go <eol> and towards his silent room , expectant wend <eol> seeking a blessing , even leave to dwell <eol> for some eternal minutes in his eyes <eol> and he smiled on me in his loving wise <eol> his hand spoke friendship , satisfied me well <eol> my presence was some pleasure , i could tell <eol> then forth we went beneath the smoky skies <eol>
