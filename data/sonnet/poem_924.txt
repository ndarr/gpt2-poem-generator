thee had we followed through the twilight land <eol> where thought grows form , and matter is refined <eol> back into thought of the eternal mind <eol> till , seeing them one , lo , in the morn we stand <eol> then started fresh and followed , hand in hand <eol> with sense divinely growing , till , combined <eol> we heard the music of the planets wind <eol> in harmony with billows on the strand <eol> till , one with earth and all god 's utterance <eol> we hardly knew whether the sun outspake <eol> or a glad sunshine from our spirits brake <eol> whether we think , or winds and blossoms dance <eol> alas , o poet leader , for such good <eol> thou wast god 's tragedy , writ in tears and blood <eol>
