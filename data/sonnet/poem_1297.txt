autumn in oregon — i 'll never see <eol> those hills again , a blur of blue and rain <eol> across the old willamette . i 'll not stir <eol> a pheasant as i walk , and hear it whirr <eol> above my head , an indolent , trusting thing <eol> when all this silly dream is finished here <eol> the fellows will go home to where there fall <eol> rose petals over every street , and all <eol> the year is like a friendly festival <eol> but i shall never watch those hedges drip <eol> color , not see the tall spar of a ship <eol> in our old harbor . — they say that i am dying <eol> perhaps that 's why it all comes back again <eol> autumn in oregon and pheasants flying <eol>
