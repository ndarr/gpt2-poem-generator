nor can i not believe but that hereby <eol> great gains are mine : for thus i live remote <eol> from evil speaking ; rancour , never sought <eol> comes to me not ; malignant truth , or lie <eol> hence have i genial seasons , hence have i <eol> smooth passions , smooth discourse , and joyous thought <eol> and thus from day to day my little boat <eol> rocks in its harbour , lodging peaceably <eol> blessings be with them , and eternal praise <eol> who gave us nobler loves , and nobler cares <eol> the poets , who on earth have made us heirs <eol> of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays <eol> oh ! might my name be numbered among theirs <eol> then gladly would i end my mortal days <eol>
