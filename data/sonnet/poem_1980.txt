come back to me , who wait and watch for you <eol> or come not yet , for it is over then <eol> and long it is before you come again <eol> so far between my pleasures are and few <eol> while , when you come not , what i do i do <eol> thinking “ now when he comes , ” my sweetest “ when <eol> for one man is my world of all the men <eol> this wide world holds ; o love , my world is you <eol> howbeit , to meet you grows almost a pang <eol> because the pang of parting comes so soon <eol> my hope hangs waning , waxing , like a moon <eol> between the heavenly days on which we meet <eol> ah me , but where are now the songs i sang <eol> when life was sweet because you called them sweet <eol>
