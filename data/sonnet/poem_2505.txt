i am older than nature and her time <eol> by all the timeless age of consciousness <eol> and my adult oblivion of the clime <eol> where i was born makes me not countryless <eol> ay , and dim through my daylight thoughts escape <eol> yearnings for that land where my childhood dreamed <eol> which i cannot recall in colour or shape <eol> but haunts my hours like something that hath gleamed <eol> and yet is not as light remembered <eol> nor to the left or to the right conceived <eol> and all round me tastes as if life were dead <eol> and the world made but to be disbelieved <eol> thus i my hope on unknown truth lay ; yet <eol> how but by hope do i the unknown truth get <eol>
