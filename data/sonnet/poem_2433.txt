oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone <eol> sad luxury ! to vulgar minds unknown <eol> along the walls where speaking marbles show <eol> what worthies form the hallowed mould belew <eol> proud names , who once the reins of empire held <eol> in arms who triumphed , or in arts excelled <eol> chiefs , graced with scars , and prodigal of blood <eol> stern patriots , who for sacred freedom stood <eol> just men , by whom impartial laws were given <eol> and saints , who taught and led the way to heaven <eol> ne'er to these chambers , where the mighty rest <eol> since their foundation came a nobler guest <eol> nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed <eol> a fairer spirit or more welcome shade <eol>
