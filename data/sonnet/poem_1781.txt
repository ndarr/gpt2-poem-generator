how sweet to be thus nestling deep in boughs <eol> upon an ashen stoven pillowing me <eol> faintly are heard the ploughmen at their ploughs <eol> but not an eye can find its way to see <eol> the sunbeams scarce molest me with a smile <eol> so thickly the leafy armies gather round <eol> and where they do , the breeze blows cool the while <eol> their leafy shadows dancing on the ground <eol> full many a flower , too , wishing to be seen <eol> perks up its head the hiding grass between <eol> in mid wood silence , thus , how sweet to be <eol> where all the noises , that on peace intrude <eol> come from the chittering cricket , bird , and bee <eol> whose songs have charms to sweeten solitude <eol>
