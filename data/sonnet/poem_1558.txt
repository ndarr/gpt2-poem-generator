therefore myself is that one only thing <eol> i hold to use or waste , to keep or give <eol> my sole possession every day i live <eol> and still mine own despite time 's winnowing <eol> ever mine own , while moons and seasons bring <eol> from crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative <eol> ever mine own , till death shall ply his sieve <eol> and still mine own , when saints break grave and sing <eol> and this myself as king unto my king <eol> i give , to him who gave himself for me <eol> who gives himself to me , and bids me sing <eol> a sweet new song of his redeemed set free <eol> he bids me sing : o death , where is thy sting <eol> and sing : o grave , where is thy victory <eol>
