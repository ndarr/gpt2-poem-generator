i thank you , kind and best belov Ã« d friend <eol> with the same thanks one murmurs to a sister <eol> when , for some gentle favor , he hath kissed her <eol> less for the gifts than for the love you send <eol> less for the flowers than what the flowers convey <eol> if i , indeed , divine their meaning truly <eol> and not unto myself ascribe , unduly <eol> things which you neither meant nor wished to say <eol> oh ! tell me , is the hope then all misplaced <eol> and am i flattered by my own affection <eol> but in your beauteous gift , methought i traced <eol> something above a short lived predilection <eol> and which , for that i know no dearer name <eol> i designate as love , without love 's flame <eol>
