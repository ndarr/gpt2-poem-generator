if there be any one can take my place <eol> and make you happy whom i grieve to grieve <eol> think not that i can grudge it , but believe <eol> i do commend you to that nobler grace <eol> that readier wit than mine , that sweeter face <eol> yea , since your riches make me rich , conceive <eol> i too am crowned , while bridal crowns i weave <eol> and thread the bridal dance with jocund pace <eol> for if i did not love you , it might be <eol> that i should grudge you some one dear delight <eol> but since the heart is yours that was mine own <eol> your pleasure is my pleasure , right my right <eol> your honorable freedom makes me free <eol> and you companioned i am not alone <eol>
