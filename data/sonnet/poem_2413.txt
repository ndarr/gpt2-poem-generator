in the chill silence of the winter eve <eol> thro ’ lichfield 's darken 'd streets i bend my way <eol> by that sad mansion , where nerina 's clay <eol> awaits the morning knell ;— and awed perceive <eol> in the late bridal chamber , the clear ray <eol> of numerous lights ; while o'er the ceiling stray <eol> shadows of those who frequent pass beneath <eol> round the pale dead .— what sounds my senses grieve <eol> for now the busy hammer 's stroke appals <eol> that , “ in dread note of preparation ,” falls <eol> closing the sable lid !— with sighs i bear <eol> these solemn warnings from the house of woes <eol> pondering how late , for young nerina , there <eol> joyous , the love illumin 'd morn arose <eol>
