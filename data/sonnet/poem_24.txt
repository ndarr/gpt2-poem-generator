at midnight when the moonlit cypress trees <eol> have woven round his grave a magic shade <eol> still weeping the unfinished hymn he made <eol> there moves fresh maia like a morning breeze <eol> blown over jonquil beds when warm rains cease <eol> and stooping where her poet 's head is laid <eol> selene weeps while all the tides are stayed <eol> and swaying seas are darkened into peace <eol> but they who wake the meadows and the tides <eol> have hearts too kind to bid him wake from sleep <eol> who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are deep <eol> startling the quiet land where he abides <eol> and charming still , sad eyed persephone <eol> with visions of the sunny earth and sea <eol>
