the crimson panes like blood drops stigmatise <eol> the western floor . the aisles are mute and cold <eol> a rigid fetich in her robe of gold <eol> the virgin of the pillar , with blank eyes <eol> enthroned beneath her votive canopies <eol> gathers a meagre remnant to her fold <eol> the rest is solitude ; the church , grown old <eol> stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies <eol> well nigh again its mighty framework grows <eol> to be a part of nature 's self , withdrawn <eol> from hot humanity 's impatient woes <eol> the floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn <eol> and in the east one giant window shows <eol> the roseate coldness of an alp at dawn <eol>
