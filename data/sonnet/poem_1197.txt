the sea is never quiet : east and west <eol> the nations hear it , like the voice of fate <eol> within vast shores its strife makes desolate <eol> still murmuring mid storms that to its breast <eol> return , as eagles screaming to their nest <eol> is it the voice of worlds and isles that wait <eol> while old earth crumbles to eternal rest <eol> or some hoar monster calling to his mate <eol> o ye , that hear it moan about the shore <eol> be still and listen ! that loud voice hath sung <eol> where mountains rise , where desert sands are blown <eol> and when man 's voice is dumb , forevermore <eol> â€˜ twill murmur on its craggy shores among <eol> singing of gods and nations overthrown <eol>
