‘ neath myriad mellow tapers ’ golden glow <eol> a woman stands , proud , insolent and fair <eol> a single gem meshed in the dusk dyed hair <eol> burns like the evening star descending low <eol> adown the dark'ning sky . upon the snow <eol> of her full blossomed breast deep rubies lie <eol> her fragrant presence breathes sweet sorcery <eol> the shimmering saffron satin 's flexile flow <eol> outlines each sinuous curve ; a sensuous smile <eol> a touch that fires to flame each pulsant vein <eol> one draught of eyes more deep than depths of wine <eol> the senses steal , the soul and brain beguile <eol> till all seem merged in feeling ... and again <eol> a circe 's spells transform men into swine <eol>
