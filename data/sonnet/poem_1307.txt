the wind was soft before the sunset fled <eol> now , while the cloud enshrouded corpse of day <eol> is lowered along a red funereal way <eol> down to the dark that knows not white from red <eol> a clear sheer breeze against the night makes head <eol> serene , but sure of life as ere a ray <eol> springs , or the dusk of dawn knows red from grey <eol> being as a soul that knows not quick from dead <eol> from far beyond the sunset , far above <eol> full toward the starry soundless east it blows <eol> bright as a child 's breath breathing on a rose <eol> smooth to the sense as plume of any dove <eol> till more and more as darkness grows and glows <eol> silence and night seem likest life and love <eol>
