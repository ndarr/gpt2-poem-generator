dear cymru , mid thy mountains soaring high <eol> dwells genius , basking on thy quiet air <eol> and heavenly shades , and solitude more rare <eol> and all wrapt round with fullest harmony <eol> of streams which fall afar . thus pleasantly <eol> ‘ neath nature their fit foster mother 's care <eol> thy children learn from infant hours to bear <eol> and work the will of god . thy scenery <eol> so varied wild , so strangely sweet and strong <eol> works on them and to music moulds their mind <eol> till flows their fancy in poetic rills <eol> the voice of nature breathes in every song <eol> and we may read therein thy features kind <eol> as in some tarn that nestles ‘ neath thy hills <eol>
