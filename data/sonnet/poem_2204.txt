in token of the love which thou hast shown <eol> for this wide land of freedom , i have named <eol> a province vast , and for its beauty famed <eol> by thy dear name to be hereafter known <eol> alberta shall it be ! her fountains thrown <eol> from alps unto three oceans , to all men <eol> shall vaunt her loveliness e'en now ; and when <eol> each little hamlet to a city grown <eol> and numberless as blades of prairie grass <eol> or the thick leaves in distant forest bower <eol> great peoples hear the giant currents pass <eol> still shall the waters , bringing wealth and power <eol> speak the loved name ,â€” the land of silver springs <eol> worthy the daughter of our english kings <eol>
