â€œ o plant ! from whence i spring ! rever 'd and lov 'd <eol> who soar'st so high a pitch , thou seest as clear <eol> as earthly thought determines two obtuse <eol> in one triangle not contain 'd , so clear <eol> dost see contingencies , ere in themselves <eol> existent , looking at the point whereto <eol> all times are present , i , the whilst i scal 'd <eol> with virgil the soul purifying mount <eol> and visited the nether world of woe <eol> touching my future destiny have heard <eol> words grievous , though i feel me on all sides <eol> well squar 'd to fortune 's blows . therefore my will <eol> were satisfied to know the lot awaits me <eol> the arrow , seen beforehand , slacks its flight <eol>
