first did i fear , when first my love began <eol> possessed in fits by watchful jealousy <eol> i sought to keep what i by favour won <eol> and brooked no partner in my love to be <eol> but tyrant sickness fed upon my love <eol> and spread his ensigns , dyed with colour white <eol> then was suspicion glad for to remove <eol> and loving much did fear to lose her quite <eol> erect , fair sweet , the colors thou didst wear <eol> dislodge thy griefs ; the short'ners of content <eol> for now of life , not love , is all my fear <eol> lest life and love be both together spent <eol> live but , fair love , and banish thy disease <eol> and love , kind heart , both where and whom thou please <eol>
