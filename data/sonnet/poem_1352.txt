when , looking on the present face of things <eol> i see one man , of men the meanest too <eol> rais 'd up to sway the world , to do , undo <eol> with mighty nations for his underlings <eol> the great events with which old story rings <eol> seem vain and hollow ; i find nothing great <eol> nothing is left which i can venerate <eol> so that almost a doubt within me springs <eol> of providence , such emptiness at length <eol> seems at the heart of all things . but , great god <eol> i measure back the steps which i have trod <eol> and tremble , seeing , as i do , the strength <eol> of such poor instruments , with thoughts sublime <eol> i tremble at the sorrow of the time <eol>
