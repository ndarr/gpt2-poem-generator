dunbar , no poet wears your laurels now <eol> none rises , singing , from your race like you <eol> dark melodist , immortal , though the dew <eol> fell early on the bays upon your brow <eol> and tinged with pathos every halcyon vow <eol> and brave endeavor . silence o'er you threw <eol> flowerets of love . or , if an envious few <eol> of your own people brought no garlands , how <eol> could malice smite him whom the gods had crowned <eol> if , like the meadow lark , your flight was low <eol> your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned <eol> a wide world heard you , and it loved you so <eol> it stilled its heart to list the strains you sang <eol> and o'er your happy songs its plaudits rang <eol>
