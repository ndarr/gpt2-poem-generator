how yesterday is long ago ! the past <eol> is a fixed infinite distance from to day <eol> and bygone things , the first lived as the last <eol> in irreparable sameness far away <eol> how the to be is infinitely ever <eol> out of the place wherein it will be now <eol> like the seen wave yet far up in the river <eol> which reaches not us , but the new waved flow <eol> this thing time is , whose being is having none <eol> the equable tyrant of our different fates <eol> who could not be bought off by a shattered sun <eol> or tricked by new use of our careful dates <eol> this thing time is , that to the grave will bear <eol> my heart , sure but of it and of my fear <eol>
