aye , you may see their graves — you who have toiled <eol> and tripped and thirsted , like these men of ours <eol> for , verily , i say that not so deep <eol> their bones are that the scattered drift and dust <eol> of gusty days will never leave them bare <eol> o dear , dead , bleaching bones ! i know of those <eol> who have the wild , strong will to go and sit <eol> outside all things with you , and keep the ways <eol> aloof from bats , and snakes , and trampling feet <eol> that smite your peace and theirs — who have the heart <eol> without the lusty limbs , to face the fire <eol> and moonless midnights , and to be , indeed <eol> for very sorrow , like a moaning wind <eol> in wintry forests with perpetual rain <eol>
