long has the pall of midnight quench 'd the scene <eol> and wrapt the hush 'd horizon .— all around <eol> in scatter 'd huts , labor , in sleep profound <eol> lies stretch 'd , and rosy innocence serene <eol> slumbers ;— but creeps , with pale and starting mien <eol> benighted superstition .— fancy found <eol> the late self slaughter 'd man , in earth yet green <eol> and festering , burst from his incumbent mound <eol> roams !— and the slave of terror thinks he hears <eol> a mutter 'd groan !— sees the sunk eye , that glares <eol> as shoots the meteor .— but no more forlorn <eol> he strays ;— the spectre sinks into his tomb <eol> for now the jocund herald of the morn <eol> claps his bold wings , and sounds along the gloom <eol>
