so is it not with me as with that muse <eol> stirred by a painted beauty to his verse <eol> who heaven it self for ornament doth use <eol> and every fair with his fair doth rehearse <eol> making a couplement of proud compare <eol> with sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems <eol> with april 's first born flowers and all things rare <eol> that heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems <eol> o let me true in love but truly write <eol> and then believe me , my love is as fair <eol> as any mother 's child , though not so bright <eol> as those gold candles fixed in heaven 's air <eol> let them say more that like of hearsay well <eol> i will not praise that purpose not to sell <eol>
