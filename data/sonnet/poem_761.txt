on many a saddened hearth the evening fire <eol> burns paler as the children 's hour draws near <eol> that joyous hour his song made doubly dear <eol> and tender memories touch the faltering choir <eol> he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire <eol> aches for the voice we loved so long to hear <eol> in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear <eol> the sweet contralto that could never tire <eol> deafened with listening to a harsher strain <eol> the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry <eol> still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh <eol> oh , for our vanished orpheus once again <eol> the shadowy silence hears us call in vain <eol> his lips are hushed ; his song shall never die <eol>
