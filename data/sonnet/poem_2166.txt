sweet song flower of the mayspring of our song <eol> be welcome to us , with loving thanks and praise <eol> to his good hand who travelling on strange ways <eol> found thee forlorn and fragrant , lain along <eol> beneath dead leaves that many a winter 's wrong <eol> had rained and heaped through nigh three centuries â€™ maze <eol> above thy maybloom , hiding from our gaze <eol> the life that in thy leaves lay sweet and strong <eol> for thine have life , while many above thine head <eol> piled by the wind lie blossomless and dead <eol> so now disburdened of such load above <eol> that lay as death 's own dust upon thee shed <eol> by days too deaf to hear thee like a dove <eol> murmuring , we hear thee , bird and flower of love <eol>
