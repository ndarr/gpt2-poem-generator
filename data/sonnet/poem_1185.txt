where lies the land to which yon ship must go <eol> festively she puts forth in trim array <eol> as vigorous as a lark at break of day <eol> is she for tropic suns , or polar snow <eol> what boots the enquiry ? neither friend nor foe <eol> she cares for ; let her travel where she may <eol> she finds familiar names , a beaten way <eol> ever before her , and a wind to blow <eol> yet still i ask , what haven is her mark <eol> and , almost as it was when ships were rare <eol> from time to time , like pilgrims , here and there <eol> crossing the waters ; doubt , and something dark <eol> of the old sea some reverential fear <eol> is with me at thy farewell , joyous bark <eol>
