lo here the impost of a faith entire <eol> that love doth pay , and her disdain extorts <eol> behold the message of a chaste desire <eol> that tells the world how much my grief imports <eol> these tributary passions , beauty 's due <eol> i send those eyes , the cabinets of love <eol> that cruelty herself might grieve to view <eol> th'affliction her unkind disdain doth move <eol> and how i live , cast down from off all mirth <eol> pensive , alone , only but with despair <eol> my joys abortive perish in their birth <eol> my griefs long lived and care succeeding care <eol> this is my state , and delia 's heart is such <eol> i say no more , i fear i said too much <eol>
