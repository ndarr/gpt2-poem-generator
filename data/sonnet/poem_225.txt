great god whom i shall carve from this gray stone <eol> wherein thou liest , hid to all but me <eol> grant thou that when my art hath made thee known <eol> and others bow , i shall not worship thee <eol> but , as i pray thee now , then let me pray <eol> some greater god , — like thee to be conceived <eol> within my soul , — for strength to turn away <eol> from his new altar , when , that task achieved <eol> he , too , stands manifest . yea , let me yearn <eol> from dream to grander dream ! let me not rest <eol> content at any goal ! still bid me spurn <eol> each transient triumph on the eternal quest <eol> abjuring godlings whom my hand hath made <eol> for deity , revealed , but unportrayed <eol>
