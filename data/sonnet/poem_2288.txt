why is my verse so barren of new pride <eol> so far from variation or quick change <eol> why with the time do i not glance aside <eol> to new found methods , and to compounds strange <eol> why write i still all one , ever the same <eol> and keep invention in a noted weed <eol> that every word doth almost tell my name <eol> showing their birth , and where they did proceed <eol> o know sweet love i always write of you <eol> and you and love are still my argument <eol> so all my best is dressing old words new <eol> spending again what is already spent <eol> for as the sun is daily new and old <eol> so is my love still telling what is told <eol>
