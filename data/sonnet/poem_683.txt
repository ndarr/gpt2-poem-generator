“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all <eol> “ prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever <eol> “ from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise <eol> “ as melody from memnon to the sun <eol> “ we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule <eol> “ with a despotic sway all giant minds <eol> “ we are not impotent — we pallid stones <eol> “ not all our power is gone — not all our fame <eol> “ not all the magic of our high renown <eol> “ not all the wonder that encircles us <eol> “ not all the mysteries that in us lie <eol> “ not all the memories that hang upon <eol> “ and cling around about us as a garment <eol> “ clothing us in a robe of more than glory <eol>
