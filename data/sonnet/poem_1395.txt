a dream there is wherein we are fain to scream <eol> while struggling with ourselves we cannot speak <eol> and much of all our waking life , as weak <eol> and misconceived , eludes us like the dream <eol> for half life 's seemings are not what they seem <eol> and vain the laughs we laugh , the shrieks we shriek <eol> yea , all is vain that mars the settled meek <eol> contented quiet of our daily theme <eol> when i was young i deemed that sweets are sweet <eol> but now i deem some searching bitters are <eol> sweeter than sweets , and more refreshing far <eol> and to be relished more , and more desired <eol> and more to be pursued on eager feet <eol> on feet untired , and still on feet though tired <eol>
