whence should they come , lady ! those happy days <eol> that thy fair hand and gentle heart invoke <eol> upon my head ? alas ! such do not rise <eol> on any , of the many , who with sighs <eol> bear through this journey land of wo , life 's yoke <eol> the light of such lives not in thine own lays <eol> such were not hers , that girl , so fond , so fair <eol> beneath whose image thou hast traced thy pray'r <eol> evil , and few , upon this darksome earth <eol> must be the days of all of mortal birth <eol> then why not mine ? sweet lady ! wish again <eol> not more of joy to me , but less of pain <eol> calm slumber , when life 's troubled hours are past <eol> and with thy friendship cheer them while they last <eol>
