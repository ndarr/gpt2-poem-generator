when winter snows upon thy sable hairs <eol> and frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near <eol> when dark shall seem thy day that never clears <eol> and all lies withered that was held so dear <eol> then take this picture which i here present thee <eol> limned with a pencil not all unworthy <eol> here see the gifts that god and nature lent thee <eol> here read thyself and what i suffered for thee <eol> this may remain thy lasting monument <eol> which happily posterity may cherish <eol> these colours with thy fading are not spent <eol> these may remain when thou and i shall perish <eol> if they remain , then thou shalt live thereby <eol> they will remain , and so thou canst not die <eol>
