give me a golden pen , and let me lean <eol> on heap 'd up flowers , in regions clear , and far <eol> bring me a tablet whiter than a star <eol> or hand of hymning angel , when ‘ tis seen <eol> the silver strings of heavenly harp atween <eol> and let there glide by many a pearly car <eol> pink robes , and wavy hair , and diamond jar <eol> and half discovered wings , and glances keen <eol> the while let music wander round my ears <eol> and as it reaches each delicious ending <eol> let me write down a line of glorious tone <eol> and full of many wonders of the spheres <eol> for what a height my spirit is contending <eol> ‘ tis not content so soon to be alone <eol>
