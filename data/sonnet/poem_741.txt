rise then , my son , first partner of my fame <eol> with early toils to build thy sacred name <eol> in high behest , for his own legate known <eol> proclaim the bounties of our sire the sun <eol> tell how his fruits beneath our culture rise <eol> his stars , how glorious , gem our cloudless skies <eol> and how to us his hand hath kindly given <eol> his peaceful laws , the purest grace of heaven <eol> with power to widen his terrestrial sway <eol> and give our blessings where he gives the day <eol> yet , should the stubborn nations still prepare <eol> the shaft of slaughter for the barbarous war <eol> tell them we know to tread the crimson plain <eol> and god 's own children never yield to man <eol>
