thou poetess ! that harpest to the moon <eol> and , in soft concert to the silver tune <eol> of waters , play 'd on by the magic wind <eol> as he comes streaming , with his hair untwined <eol> dost sing light strains of melody and mirth <eol> i hear thee , hymning on thy holy birth <eol> how thou wert moulded of thy mother love <eol> that came , like seraph , from the stars above <eol> and was so sadly wedded unto sin <eol> that thou wert born , and sorrow was thy twin <eol> sorrow and mirthful lunacy ! that be <eol> together link 'd for time , i deem of ye <eol> that ye are worshipp 'd as none others are <eol> one as a lonely shadow , one a star <eol>
