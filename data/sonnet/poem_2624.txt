i wage the combat with two mighty foes <eol> which are more strong than i ten thousand fold <eol> the one is when thy pleasure i do lose <eol> the other , when thy person i behold <eol> in seeing thee a swarm of loves confound me <eol> and cause my death in spite of my resist <eol> and if i see thee not , thy want doth wound me <eol> for in thy sight my comfort doth consist <eol> the one in me continual care createth <eol> the other doth occasion my desire <eol> the one the edge of all my joy rebateth <eol> the other makes me a phoenix in love 's fire <eol> so that i grieve when i enjoy your presence <eol> and die for grief by reason of your absence <eol>
