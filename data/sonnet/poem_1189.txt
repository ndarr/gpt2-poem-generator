one do i see and twelve ; but second there <eol> methinks i know thee , thou beloved one <eol> not from thy nobler port , for there are none <eol> more quiet featured : some there are who bear <eol> their message on their brows , while others wear <eol> a look of large commission , nor will shun <eol> the fiery trial , so their work is done <eol> but thou hast parted with thine eyes in prayer <eol> unearthly are they both ; and so thy lips <eol> seem like the porches of the spirit land <eol> for thou hast laid a mighty treasure by <eol> unlocked by him in nature , and thine eye <eol> burns with a vision and apocalypse <eol> thy own sweet soul can hardly understand <eol>
