i have dreamed sweet dreams of a summer night <eol> when the moon was walking in cloudless light <eol> and my soul to the regions of fancy sprung <eol> while the spirits of air their soft anthems sung <eol> strains wafted down from those heavenly spheres <eol> which may not be warbled in waking ears <eol> more sweet than the voice of waters flowing <eol> than the breeze over beds of violets blowing <eol> when it stirs the pines , and sultry day <eol> fans himself cool with their tremulous play <eol> on the sleeper 's ear those rich notes stealing <eol> speak of purer and holier feeling <eol> than man in his pilgrimage here below <eol> in the bondage of sin , can ever know <eol>
