no , not in vain he died — not all in vain <eol> our good , great president ! this people 's hands <eol> are linked together in one mighty chain <eol> drawn tighter still in triple woven bands <eol> to crush the fiends in human masks , whose might <eol> we suffer , oh , too long ! no league , nor truce <eol> save men with men ! the devils we must fight <eol> with fire ! god wills it in this deed . this use <eol> we draw from the most impious murder done <eol> since calvary . rise then , o countrymen <eol> scatter these marsh lights hopes of union won <eol> through pardoning clemency . strike , strike again <eol> draw closer round the foe a girdling flame <eol> we are stabbed whene'er we spare — strike in god 's name <eol>
