o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem <eol> by that sweet ornament which truth doth give <eol> the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem <eol> for that sweet odour which doth in it live <eol> the canker blooms have full as deep a dye <eol> as the perfumed tincture of the roses <eol> hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly <eol> when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses <eol> but for their virtue only is their show <eol> they live unwoo 'd and unrespected fade <eol> die to themselves . sweet roses do not so <eol> of then sweet deaths are sweetest odours made <eol> and so of you , beauteous and lovely youth <eol> when that shall fade , my verse distils your truth <eol>
