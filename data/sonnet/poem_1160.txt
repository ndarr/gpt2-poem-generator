upon a summer 's day love went to swim <eol> and cast himself into a sea of tears <eol> the clouds called in their light , and heaven waxed dim <eol> and sighs did raise a tempest , causing fears <eol> the naked boy could not so wield his arms <eol> but that the waves were masters of his might <eol> and threatened him to work far greater harms <eol> if he devis è d not to scape by flight <eol> then for a boat his quiver stood instead <eol> his bow unbent did serve him for a mast <eol> whereby to sail his cloth of veil he spread <eol> his shafts for oars on either board he cast <eol> from shipwreck safe this wag got thus to shore <eol> and sware to bathe in lovers ’ tears no more <eol>
