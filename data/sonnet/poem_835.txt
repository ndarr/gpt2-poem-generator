lo , i awhile the story of the saint <eol> the song of praise of him who did the deeds <eol> have set forth here in words , a tale well known <eol> beyond my power ; much is there yet to tell <eol> a weary task â€” what he in life endured <eol> from the beginning on ! a wiser man <eol> upon the earth than i account myself <eol> must in his heart invent it , one who knows <eol> from the beginning all the misery <eol> which bravely he endured in cruel wars <eol> yet in small parts we further must relate <eol> a portion of that tale . it has been told <eol> already how he suffered many woes <eol> from grievous warfare in the heathen town <eol>
