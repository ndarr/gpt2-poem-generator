o words of all my songs . . . black butterflies <eol> wild words of all the wayward songs i sing <eol> called from the tomb of some enchanted past <eol> by that strange sphinx , my soul , they slowly rise <eol> and settle on white pages wing to wing <eol> white pages like flower petals fluttering <eol> held spellbound there till some blind hour shall bring <eol> the perfect voice that , delicate and wise <eol> shall set them free in fairyland at last <eol> that garden of all dreams and ecstasies <eol> where my soul sings through an eternal spring <eol> watching alone with enigmatic eyes <eol> dark wings on pale flower petals quivering <eol> o words of all my songs . . . black butterflies <eol>
