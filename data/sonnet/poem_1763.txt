i think i should have loved you presently <eol> and given in earnest words i flung in jest <eol> and lifted honest eyes for you to see <eol> and caught your hand against my cheek and breast <eol> and all my pretty follies flung aside <eol> that won you to me , and beneath your gaze <eol> naked of reticence and shorn of pride <eol> spread like a chart my little wicked ways <eol> i , that had been to you , had you remained <eol> but one more waking from a recurrent dream <eol> cherish no less the certain stakes i gained <eol> and walk your memory 's halls , austere , supreme <eol> a ghost in marble of a girl you knew <eol> who would have loved you in a day or two <eol>
