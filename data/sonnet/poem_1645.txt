the saint who shuts outside his placid soul <eol> all touch of sense , letting no contact through <eol> whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows <eol> whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn <eol> equal and slow through nostrils still and close <eol> that one with organs , heart , and mind constrained <eol> bent on deliverance , having put away <eol> passion , and fear , and rage ;â€” hath , even now <eol> obtained deliverance , ever and ever freed <eol> yea ! for he knows me who am he that heeds <eol> the sacrifice and worship , god revealed <eol> and he who heeds not , being lord of worlds <eol> lover of all that lives , god unrevealed <eol> wherein who will shall find surety and shield <eol>
