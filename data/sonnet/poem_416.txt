there was never a sound beside the wood but one <eol> and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground <eol> what was it it whispered ? i knew not well myself <eol> perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun <eol> something , perhaps , about the lack of sound <eol> and that was why it whispered and did not speak <eol> it was no dream of the gift of idle hours <eol> or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf <eol> anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak <eol> to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows <eol> not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers <eol> ( pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake <eol> the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows <eol> my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make <eol>
