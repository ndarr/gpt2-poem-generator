the wise world saith i not unlock 'd my heart <eol> when i of thee and thy dear love did write <eol> and would each word of mine to false convert <eol> doing my simple sense a double spite <eol> it saith thou wert but shadow born of nought <eol> but vain creation of an apish rhyme <eol> while , fashion 's fool , my strain 'd invention sought <eol> to better them who best did please the time <eol> but wherefore say they so , and do dear wrong <eol> to thee , whose worth was my sole argument <eol> to me , whose verse â€˜ twas truth alone made strong <eol> by that the breast must feel , not brain invent <eol> they who this doubt never such beauty knew <eol> nor what to poet love alone can do <eol>
