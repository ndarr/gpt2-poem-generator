i love thee when thy swelling buds appear <eol> and one by one their tender leaves unfold <eol> as if they knew that warmer suns were near <eol> nor longer sought to hide from winter 's cold <eol> and when with darker growth thy leaves are seen <eol> to veil from view the early robin 's nest <eol> i love to lie beneath thy waving screen <eol> with limbs by summer 's heat and toil oppressed <eol> and when the autumn winds have stripped thee bare <eol> and round thee lies the smooth , untrodden snow <eol> when naught is thine that made thee once so fair <eol> i love to watch thy shadowy form below <eol> and through thy leafless arms to look above <eol> on stars that brighter beam when most we need their love <eol>
