there 's not a budding boy or girl , this day <eol> but is got up , and gone to bring in may <eol> a deal of youth , ere this , is come <eol> back , and with white thorn laden home <eol> some have despatched their cakes and cream <eol> before that we have left to dream <eol> and some have wept , and wooed and plighted troth <eol> and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth <eol> many a green gown has been given <eol> many a kiss , both odd and even <eol> many a glance , too , has been sent <eol> from out the eye , love 's firmament <eol> many a jest told of the keys betraying <eol> this night , and locks picked , yet we 're not a maying <eol>
