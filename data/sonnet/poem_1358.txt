mountains ! and huge hills ! wrap your mighty forms <eol> close with mantle of eternal cloud <eol> gather around ye the fierce band of storms <eol> and let the stainless snow drift be your shroud <eol> back from your rugged steeps , and caverns hoar <eol> bellow in hoarse disdain the tempest 's roar <eol> laugh at the rolling thunder ; let the flash <eol> of its fierce lightning lumine but your scorn <eol> down your deep furrow 'd slopes let torrents dash <eol> and on the winds their hollow rage be borne <eol> ye mighty ones ! why should ye bow your pride <eol> and doff your venerable crowns , or dress <eol> your wrinkled brows in smiles , or lay aside <eol> the dread insignias of your mightiness <eol>
