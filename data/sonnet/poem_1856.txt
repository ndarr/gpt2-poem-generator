woman ! when i behold thee flippant , vain <eol> inconstant , childish , proud , and full of fancies <eol> without that modest softening that enhances <eol> the downcast eye , repentant of the pain <eol> that its mild light creates to heal again <eol> e'en then , elate , my spirit leaps , and prances <eol> e'en then my soul with exultation dances <eol> for that to love , so long , i 've dormant lain <eol> but when i see thee meek , and kind , and tender <eol> heavens ! how desperately do i adore <eol> thy winning graces ;— to be thy defender <eol> i hotly burn — to be a calidore <eol> a very red cross knight — a stout leander <eol> might i be loved by thee like these of yore <eol>
