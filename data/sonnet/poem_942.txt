many the wonders i this day have seen <eol> the sun , when first he kist away the tears <eol> that fill 'd the eyes of morn ;â€” the laurel 'd peers <eol> who from the feathery gold of evening lean <eol> the ocean with its vastness , its blue green <eol> its ships , its rocks , its caves , its hopes , its fears <eol> its voice mysterious , which whoso hears <eol> must think on what will be , and what has been <eol> e'en now , dear george , while this for you i write <eol> cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping <eol> so scantly , that it seems her bridal night <eol> and she her half discover 'd revels keeping <eol> but what , without the social thought of thee <eol> would be the wonders of the sky and sea <eol>
