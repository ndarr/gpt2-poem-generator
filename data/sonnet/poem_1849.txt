when autumn suns are soft , and sea winds moan <eol> and golden fruits make sweet the golden air <eol> in gardens where the apple blossoms were <eol> in these old springs before i walked alone <eol> i pass among the pathways overgrown <eol> of all the former flowers that kissed your feet <eol> remains a poppy , pallid from the heat <eol> a wild poppy that the wild winds have sown <eol> alas ! the rose forgets your hands of rose <eol> the lilies slumber in the lily bed <eol> â€˜ tis only poppies in the dreamy close <eol> the changeless , windless garden of the dead <eol> you tend , with buds soft as your kiss that lies <eol> in over happy dreams , upon mine eyes <eol>
