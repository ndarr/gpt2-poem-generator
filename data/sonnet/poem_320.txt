are these wild thoughts , thus fettered in my rhymes <eol> indeed the product of my heart and brain <eol> how strange that on my ear the rhythmic strain <eol> falls like faint memories of far off times <eol> when did i feel the sorrow , act the part <eol> which i have striv'n to shadow forth in song <eol> in what dead century swept that mingled throng <eol> of mighty pains and pleasures through my heart <eol> not in the yesterdays of that still life <eol> which i have passed so free and far from strife <eol> but somewhere in this weary world i know <eol> in some strange land , beneath some orient clime <eol> i saw or shared a martyrdom sublime <eol> and felt a deeper grief than any later woe <eol>
