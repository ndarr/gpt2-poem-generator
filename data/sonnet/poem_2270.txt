these sorrowing sighs , the smoke of mine annoy <eol> these tears , which heat of sacred flame distils <eol> are those due tributes that my faith doth pay <eol> unto the tyrant whose unkindness kills <eol> i sacrifice my youth and blooming years <eol> at her proud feet , and she respects not it <eol> my flower , untimely 's withered with my tears <eol> by winter woes for spring of youth unfit <eol> she thinks a look may recompense my care <eol> and so with looks prolongs my long looked ease <eol> as short that bliss , so is the comfort rare <eol> yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease <eol> thus she returns my hopes so fruitless ever <eol> once let her love indeed , or eye me never <eol>
