o lords our gods , the times are evil : you <eol> redeem the time , because of evil days <eol> while abject souls in servitude of praise <eol> bow down to heads untitled , and the crew <eol> whose honour dwells but in the deeds they do <eol> from loftier hearts your nobler servants raise <eol> more manful salutation : yours are bays <eol> that not the dawn 's plebeian pearls bedew <eol> yours , laurels plucked not of such hands as wove <eol> old age its chaplet in colonos â€™ grove <eol> our time , with heaven and with itself at odds <eol> makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil <eol> but yours are yet the corn and wine and oil <eol> and yours our worship yet , o lords our gods <eol>
