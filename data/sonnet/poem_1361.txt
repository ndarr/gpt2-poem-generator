death in a rage assaulted once my heart <eol> with love of her , my love that doth deny <eol> i scorned his force , and wished him to depart <eol> i heartless was , and therefore could not die <eol> i live in her , in her i placed my life <eol> she guides my soul , and her i honour must <eol> nor is this life but yet a living strife <eol> a thing unmeet , and yet a thing most just <eol> cupid enraged did fly to make me love <eol> my heart lay guarded with those burning eyes <eol> the sparks whereof denied him to remove <eol> so conquered now , he like a captive lies <eol> thus two at once by love were both undone <eol> my heart not loved , and armless venus â€™ son <eol>
