pride of the sister realm so long our own <eol> we claim with her that spotless fame of thine <eol> white as her snow and fragrant as her pine <eol> ours was thy birthplace , but in every zone <eol> some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown <eol> breathes perfume from its blossoms , that entwine <eol> where'er the dewdrops fall , the sunbeams shine <eol> on life 's long path with tangled cares o'ergrown <eol> can art thy truthful counterfeit command <eol> the silver haloed features , tranquil , mild <eol> soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled <eol> give warmth and pressure to the marble hand <eol> seek the lost rainbow in the sky it spanned <eol> farewell , sweet singer ! heaven reclaims its child <eol>
