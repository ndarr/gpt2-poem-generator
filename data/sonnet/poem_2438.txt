through suffering and sorrow thou hast passed <eol> to show us what a woman true may be <eol> they have not taken sympathy from thee <eol> nor made thee any other than thou wast <eol> save as some tree , which , in a sudden blast <eol> sheddeth those blossoms , that are weakly grown <eol> upon the air , but keepeth every one <eol> whose strength gives warrant of good fruit at last <eol> so thou hast shed some blooms of gayety <eol> but never one of steadfast cheerfulness <eol> nor hath thy knowledge of adversity <eol> robbed thee of any faith in happiness <eol> but rather cleared thine inner eyes to see <eol> how many simple ways there are to bless <eol>
