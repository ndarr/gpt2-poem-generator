devouring time blunt thou the lion 's paws <eol> and make the earth devour her own sweet brood <eol> pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws <eol> and burn the long lived phoenix , in her blood <eol> make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st <eol> and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time <eol> to the wide world and all her fading sweets <eol> but i forbid thee one most heinous crime <eol> o carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow <eol> nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen <eol> him in thy course untainted do allow <eol> for beauty 's pattern to succeeding men <eol> yet do thy worst old time : despite thy wrong <eol> my love shall in my verse ever live young <eol>
