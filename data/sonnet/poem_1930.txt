like as the dove , which seeled up doth fly <eol> is neither freed , nor yet to service bound <eol> but hopes to gain some help by mounting high <eol> till want of force do force her fall to ground <eol> right so my mind , caught by his guiding eye <eol> and thence cast off where his sweet hurt he found <eol> hath neither leave to live , nor doom to die <eol> nor held in evil , nor suffered to be sound <eol> but with his wings of fancies up he goes <eol> to high conceits , whose fruits are oft but small <eol> till wounded , blind , and wearied spirit , lose <eol> both force to fly , and knowledge where to fall <eol> o happy dove , if she no bondage tried <eol> more happy i , might i in bondage bide <eol>
