there is no picturesqueness and no glory <eol> no halo of romance , in war to day <eol> it is a hideous thing ; time would turn grey <eol> with horror , were he not already hoary <eol> at sight of this vile monster , foul and gory <eol> yet while sweet women perish as they pray <eol> and new born babes are slaughtered , who dare say <eol> ‘ halt ! ’ till right pens its ‘ finis ’ to the story <eol> there is no pathway , but the path through blood <eol> out of the horrors of this holocaust <eol> hell has let loose its scalding crimson flood <eol> and he who stops to argue now is lost <eol> not brooms of creeds , not pacifistic words <eol> can stem the tide , but swords — uplifted swords <eol>
