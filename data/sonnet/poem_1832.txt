cruel fair love , i justly do complain <eol> of too much rigor and thy heart unkind <eol> that for mine eyes thou hast my body slain <eol> and would not grant that i should favour find <eol> i looked , fair love , and you my love looked fair <eol> i sighed for love and you for sport did smile <eol> your smiles were such as did perfume the air <eol> and this perfum è d did my heart beguile <eol> thus i confess the fault was in mine eyes <eol> begun with sighs and ended with a flame <eol> i for your love did all the world despise <eol> and in these poems honored have your name <eol> then let your love so with my fault dispense <eol> that all my parts feel not mine eyes ’ offense <eol>
