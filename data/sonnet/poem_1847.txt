â€œ ay ! quail and cringe and crook the supple knee <eol> and beg thy life of me , thine enemy <eol> whom thou , a moment since , didst doom to death <eol> i will not breathe suspicion 's lightest breath <eol> against thy vaunted fame : and even though <eol> before all men thou'st sworn thyself my foe <eol> and pledged thyself wrongly to wreak on me <eol> thy utmost power of mortal injury <eol> in spite of this , should i be first to die <eol> and win the bowers of the blest on high <eol> beside the golden gate of paradise <eol> thee will i wait with ever watchful eyes <eol> ready to plead forgiveness for thy sin <eol> if thou shouldst come , and shouldst not enter in <eol>
