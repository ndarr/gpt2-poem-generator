edith ( rising and breaking into a kind of chant <eol> truly we do but grope here in the dark <eol> near the partition wall of life and death <eol> at every moment dreading or desiring <eol> to lay our hands upon the unseen door <eol> let us , then , labor for an inward stillness <eol> an inward stillness and an inward healing <eol> that perfect silence where the lips and heart <eol> are still , and we no longer entertain <eol> our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions <eol> but god alone speaks in us , and we wait <eol> in singleness of heart , that we may know <eol> his will , and in the silence of our spirits <eol> that we may do his will , and do that only <eol>
