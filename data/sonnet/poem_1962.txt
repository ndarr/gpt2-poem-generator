all night i wrestled with a memory <eol> which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought <eol> the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought <eol> its disillusion ; now i only cry <eol> for peace , for power to forget the lie <eol> which hope too long has whispered . so i sought <eol> the sleep which would not come , and night was fraught <eol> with old emotions weeping silently <eol> i heard your voice again , and knew the things <eol> which you had promised proved an empty vaunt <eol> i felt your clinging hands while night 's broad wings <eol> cherished our love in darkness . from the lawn <eol> a sudden , quivering birdnote , like a taunt <eol> my arms held nothing but the empty dawn <eol>
