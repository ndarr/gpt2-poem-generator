i never gave a lock of hair away <eol> to a man , dearest , except this to thee <eol> which now upon my fingers thoughtfully <eol> i ring out to the full brown length and say <eol> “ take it . ” my day of youth went yesterday <eol> my hair no longer bounds to my foot 's glee <eol> nor plant i it from rose or myrtle tree <eol> as girls do , any more : it only may <eol> now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears <eol> taught drooping from the head that hangs aside <eol> through sorrow 's trick . i thought the funeral shears <eol> would take this first , but love is justified <eol> take it thou ,— finding pure , from all those years <eol> the kiss my mother left here when she died <eol>
