woe ! woe to me , on me return the smart <eol> my burning tongue hath bred my mistress pain <eol> for oft in pain , to pain my painful heart <eol> with her due praise did of my state complain <eol> i praised her eyes , whom never chance doth move <eol> her breath , which makes a sour answer sweet <eol> her milken breasts , the nurse of child like love <eol> her legs , o legs ! her aye well stepping feet <eol> pain heard her praise , and full of inward fire <eol> ( first sealing up my heart as prey of his <eol> he flies to her , and , boldened with desire <eol> her face , this age 's praise , the thief doth kiss <eol> o pain ! i now recant the praise i gave <eol> and swear she is not worthy thee to have <eol>
