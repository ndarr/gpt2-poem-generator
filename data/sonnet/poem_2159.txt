when i consider how my light is spent <eol> ere half my days , in this dark world and wide <eol> and that one talent , which is death to hide <eol> lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent <eol> to serve therewith my maker , and present <eol> my true account , lest he , returning , chide <eol> ‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied <eol> i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent <eol> that murmur , soon replies : ‘ god doth not need <eol> either man 's work or his own gifts . who best <eol> bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state <eol> is kingly . thousands , at his bidding , speed <eol> and post o'er land and ocean , without rest <eol> they also serve who only stand and wait <eol>
