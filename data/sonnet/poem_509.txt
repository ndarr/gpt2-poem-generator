and you as well must die , beloved dust <eol> and all your beauty stand you in no stead <eol> this flawless , vital hand , this perfect head <eol> this body of flame and steel , before the gust <eol> of death , or under his autumnal frost <eol> shall be as any leaf , be no less dead <eol> than the first leaf that fell ,â€” this wonder fled <eol> altered , estranged , disintegrated , lost <eol> nor shall my love avail you in your hour <eol> in spite of all my love , you will arise <eol> upon that day and wander down the air <eol> obscurely as the unattended flower <eol> it mattering not how beautiful you were <eol> or how beloved above all else that dies <eol>
