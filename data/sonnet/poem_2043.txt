when in the widening circle of rebirth <eol> to a new flesh my travelled soul shall come <eol> and try again the unremembered earth <eol> with the old sadness for the immortal home <eol> shall i revisit these same differing fields <eol> and cull the old new flowers with the same sense <eol> that some small breath of foiled remembrance yields <eol> of more age than my days in this pretence <eol> shall i again regret strange faces lost <eol> of which the present memory is forgot <eol> and but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed <eol> out of the closed sea and black night of thought <eol> were thy face one , what sweetness will â€™ t not be <eol> though by blind feeling , to remember thee <eol>
