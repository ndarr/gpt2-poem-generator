i thought our love at full , but i did err <eol> joy 's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes ; i could not see <eol> that sorrow in our happy world must be <eol> love 's deepest spokesman and interpreter <eol> but , as a mother feels her child first stir <eol> under her heart , so felt i instantly <eol> deep in my soul another bond to thee <eol> thrill with that life we saw depart from her <eol> o mother of our angel child ! twice dear <eol> death knits as well as parts , and still , i wis <eol> her tender radiance shall infold us here <eol> even as the light , borne up by inward bliss <eol> threads the void glooms of space without a fear <eol> to print on farthest stars her pitying kiss <eol>
