not causeless were you christened , gentle flowers <eol> the one of faith , the other fancy 's pride <eol> for she who guides both faith and fancy 's power <eol> in your fair colors wraps her ivory side <eol> as one of you hath whiteness without stain <eol> so spotless is my love and never tainted <eol> and as the other shadoweth faith again <eol> such is my lass , with no fond change acquainted <eol> and as nor tyrant sun nor winter weather <eol> may ever change sweet amaranthus â€™ hue <eol> so she though love and fortune join together <eol> will never leave to be both fair and true <eol> and should i leave thee then , thou pretty elf <eol> nay , first let damon quite forget himself <eol>
