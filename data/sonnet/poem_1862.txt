each day , new proofs of new despair i find <eol> that is , new deaths . no marvel then , though i <eol> make exile my last help ; to th'end mine eye <eol> should not behold the death to me assigned <eol> not that from death absence might save my mind <eol> but that it might take death more patiently <eol> like him , the which by judge condemned to die <eol> to suffer with more ease , his eyes doth blind <eol> your lips in scarlet clad , my judges be <eol> pronouncing sentence of eternal â€œ no <eol> despair , the hangman that tormenteth me <eol> the death i suffer is the life i have <eol> for only life doth make me die in woe <eol> and only death i for my pardon crave <eol>
