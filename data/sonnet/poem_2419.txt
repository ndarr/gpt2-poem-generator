i never saw that you did painting need <eol> and therefore to your fair no painting set <eol> i found ( or thought i found ) you did exceed <eol> that barren tender of a poet 's debt <eol> and therefore have i slept in your report <eol> that you your self being extant well might show <eol> how far a modern quill doth come too short <eol> speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow <eol> this silence for my sin you did impute <eol> which shall be most my glory being dumb <eol> for i impair not beauty being mute <eol> when others would give life , and bring a tomb <eol> there lives more life in one of your fair eyes <eol> than both your poets can in praise devise <eol>
