thou radiant coachman , running endless course <eol> fountain of heat , of light the lively source <eol> life of the world , lamp of this universe <eol> heaven 's richest gem : oh , teach me where my verse <eol> may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare <eol> much like to one that in the clouds doth stare <eol> to count the quails , that with their shadow cover <eol> the italian sea , when soaring hither over <eol> fain of a milder and more fruitful clime <eol> they come with us to pass the summer time <eol> no sooner he begins one shoal to sum <eol> but , more and more , still greater shoals do come <eol> swarm upon swarm , that with their countless number <eol> break off his purpose , and his sense encumber <eol>
