when you were born , beloved , was your soul <eol> new made by god to match your body 's flower <eol> and were they both at one same precious hour <eol> sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole <eol> or had your soul since dim creation burned <eol> a star in some still region of the sky <eol> that leaping earthward , left its place on high <eol> and to your little new born body yearned <eol> no words can tell in what celestial hour <eol> god made your soul and gave it mortal birth <eol> nor in the disarray of all the stars <eol> is any place so sweet that such a flower <eol> might linger there until thro â€™ heaven 's bars <eol> it heard god 's voice that bade it down to earth <eol>
