up at his attic sill the south wind came <eol> and days of sun and storm but never peace <eol> along the town 's tumultuous arteries <eol> he heard the heart throbs of a sentient frame <eol> each night the whistles in the bay , the same <eol> whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars <eol> for smoke that half obscured , the circling stars <eol> burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame <eol> up to his attic came the city cries <eol> the throes with which her iron sinews heave <eol> and yet forever behind prison doors <eol> welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes <eol> the light that hangs on desert hills at eve <eol> and tints the sea on solitary shores <eol>
