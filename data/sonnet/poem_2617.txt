i thank all who have loved me in their hearts <eol> with thanks and love from mine . deep thanks to all <eol> who paused a little near the prison wall <eol> to hear my music in its louder parts <eol> ere they went onward , each one to the mart 's <eol> or temple 's occupation , beyond call <eol> but thou , who , in my voice 's sink and fall <eol> when the sob took it , thy divinest art 's <eol> own instrument didst drop down at thy foot <eol> to harken what i said between my tears <eol> instruct me how to thank thee ! oh , to shoot <eol> my soul 's full meaning into future years <eol> that they should lend it utterance , and salute <eol> love that endures , from life that disappears <eol>
