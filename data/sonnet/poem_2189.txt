were but my spirit loosed upon the air <eol> by some high power who could life 's chains unbind <eol> set free to seek what most it longs to find <eol> to no proud court of kings would i repair <eol> i would but climb , once more , a narrow stair <eol> when day was wearing late , and dusk was kind <eol> and one should greet me to my failings blind <eol> content so i but shared his twilight there <eol> nay ! well i know he waits not as of old <eol> i could not find him in the old time place <eol> i must pursue him , made by sorrow bold <eol> through worlds unknown , in strange celestial race <eol> whose mystic round no traveller has told <eol> from star to star , until i see his face <eol>
