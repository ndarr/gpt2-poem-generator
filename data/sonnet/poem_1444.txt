i see thine image through my tears to night <eol> and yet to day i saw thee smiling . how <eol> refer the cause ?— beloved , is it thou <eol> or i , who makes me sad ? the acolyte <eol> amid the chanted joy and thankful rite <eol> may so fall flat , with pale insensate brow <eol> on the altar stair . i hear thy voice and vow <eol> perplexed , uncertain , since thou art out of sight <eol> as he , in his swooning ears , the choir 's amen <eol> beloved , dost thou love ? or did i see all <eol> the glory as i dreamed , and fainted when <eol> too vehement light dilated my ideal <eol> for my soul 's eyes ? will that light come again <eol> as now these tears come — falling hot and real <eol>
