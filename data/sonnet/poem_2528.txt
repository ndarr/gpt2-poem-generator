each soul i might have succored , may have slain <eol> all souls shall face me at the last appeal <eol> that great last moment poised for woe or weal <eol> that final moment for man 's bliss or bane <eol> vanity of vanities , yea all is vain <eol> which then will not avail or help or heal <eol> disfeatured faces , worn out knees that kneel <eol> will more avail than strength or beauty then <eol> lord , by thy passion ,â€” when thy face was marred <eol> in sight of earth and hell tumultuous <eol> and thy heart failed in thee like melting wax <eol> and thy blood dropped more precious than the nard <eol> lord , for thy sake , not ours , supply our lacks <eol> for thine own sake , not ours , christ , pity us <eol>
