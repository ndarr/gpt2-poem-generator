my poet , thou canst touch on all the notes <eol> god set between his after and before <eol> and strike up and strike off the general roar <eol> of the rushing worlds a melody that floats <eol> in a serene air purely . antidotes <eol> of medicated music , answering for <eol> mankind 's forlornest uses , thou canst pour <eol> from thence into their ears . god 's will devotes <eol> thine to such ends , and mine to wait on thine <eol> how , dearest , wilt thou have me for most use <eol> a hope , to sing by gladly ? or a fine <eol> sad memory , with thy songs to interfuse <eol> a shade , in which to sing â€” of palm or pine <eol> a grave , on which to rest from singing ? choose <eol>
