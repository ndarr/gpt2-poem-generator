the midnight is not more bewildering <eol> to her drowsed eyes , than to her ears , the sound <eol> of dim , sweet singing voices , interwound <eol> with purl of flute and subtle twang of string <eol> strained through the lattice , where the roses cling <eol> and , with their fragrance , waft the notes around <eol> her haunted senses . thirsting beyond bound <eol> of her slow yielding dreams , the lilt and swing <eol> of the mysterious delirious tune <eol> she drains like some strange opiate , with awed eyes <eol> upraised against her casement , where aswoon <eol> the stars fail from her sight , and up the skies <eol> of alien azure rolls the full round moon <eol> like some vast bubble blown of summer noon <eol>
