it is not death which wretched men call dying <eol> but that is very death which i endure <eol> when my coy looking nymph , her grace envying <eol> by fatal frowns my domage doth procure <eol> it is not life which we for life approve <eol> but that is life when on her wool soft paps <eol> i seal sweet kisses which do batten love <eol> and doubling them do treble my good haps <eol> â€˜ tis neither love the son , nor love the mother <eol> which lovers praise and pray to ; but that love is <eol> which she in eye and i in heart do smother <eol> then muse not though i glory in my miss <eol> since she who holds my heart and me in durance <eol> hath life , death , love and all in her procurance <eol>
