â€˜ for this true nobleness i seek in vain <eol> in woman and in man i find it not <eol> i almost weary of my earthly lot <eol> my life springs are dried up with burning pain <eol> thou find'st it not ? i pray thee look again <eol> look inward through the depths of thine own soul <eol> how is it with thee ? art thou sound and whole <eol> doth narrow search show thee no earthly stain <eol> be noble ! and the nobleness that lies <eol> in other men , sleeping , but never dead <eol> will rise in majesty to meet thine own <eol> then wilt thou see it gleam in many eyes <eol> then will pure light around thy path be shed <eol> and thou wilt nevermore be sad and lone <eol>
