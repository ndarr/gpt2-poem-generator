christ , dost thou live indeed ? or are thy bones <eol> still straitened in their rock hewn sepulchre <eol> and was thy rising only dreamed by her <eol> whose love of thee for all her sin atones <eol> for here the air is horrid with men 's groans <eol> the priests who call upon thy name are slain <eol> dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain <eol> from those whose children lie upon the stones <eol> come down , o son of god ! incestuous gloom <eol> curtains the land , and through the starless night <eol> over thy cross a crescent moon i see <eol> if thou in very truth didst burst the tomb <eol> come down , o son of man ! and show thy might <eol> lest mahomet be crowned instead of thee <eol>
