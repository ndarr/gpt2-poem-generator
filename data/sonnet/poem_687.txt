my angel sister , tho ’ thy lovely form <eol> perish 'd in youth 's gay morning , yet is mine <eol> this precious ringlet !— still the soft hairs shine <eol> still glow the nut brown tints , all bright and warm <eol> with sunny gleam !— alas ! each kindred charm <eol> vanish 'd long since ; deep in the silent shrine <eol> wither 'd to shapeless dust !— and of their grace <eol> memory alone retains the faithful trace <eol> dear lock , had thy sweet owner liv 'd , ere now <eol> time on her brow had faded thee !— my care <eol> screen 'd from the sun and dew thy golden glow <eol> and thus her early beauty dost thou wear <eol> thou all of that fair frame my love cou 'd save <eol> from the resistless ravage of the grave <eol>
