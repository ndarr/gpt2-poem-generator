returning from its daily quest , my spirit <eol> changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find <eol> it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind <eol> those ample virtues which it did inherit <eol> has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude <eol> of blind and madding men — i then loved thee <eol> i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood <eol> when thou wert faithful to thyself and me <eol> i dare not now through thy degraded state <eol> own the delight thy strains inspire — in vain <eol> i seek what once thou wert — we cannot meet <eol> and we were wont . again and yet again <eol> ponder my words : so the false spirit shall fly <eol> and leave to thee thy true integrity <eol>
