o king , whose greatness none can comprehend <eol> whose boundless goodness doth to all extend <eol> light of all beauty ! ocean without ground <eol> that standing flowest , giving dost abound <eol> rich palace , and indweller ever blest <eol> never not working , ever yet in rest <eol> what wit cannot conceive , words say of thee <eol> here , where , as in a mirror , we but see <eol> shadows of shadows , atoms of thy might <eol> still owly eyed while staring on thy light <eol> grant that , released from this earthly jail <eol> and freed of clouds which here our knowledge veil <eol> in heaven 's high temples , where thy praises ring <eol> i may in sweeter notes hear angels sing <eol>
