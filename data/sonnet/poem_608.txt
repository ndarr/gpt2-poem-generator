take of the first fruits , father , of thy care <eol> wrapped in the fresh leaves of my gratitude <eol> late waked for early gifts ill understood <eol> claiming in all my harvests rightful share <eol> whether with song that mounts the joyful air <eol> i praise my god , or , in yet deeper mood <eol> sit dumb because i know a speechless good <eol> needing no voice , but all the soul for prayer <eol> thou hast been faithful to my highest need <eol> and i , thy debtor , ever , evermore <eol> shall never feel the grateful burden sore <eol> yet most i thank thee , not for any deed <eol> but for the sense thy living self did breed <eol> of fatherhood still at the great world 's core <eol>
