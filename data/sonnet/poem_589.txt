this is the golden book of spirit and sense <eol> the holy writ of beauty ; he that wrought <eol> made it with dreams and faultless words and thought <eol> that seeks and finds and loses in the dense <eol> dim air of life that beauty 's excellence <eol> wherewith love makes one hour of life distraught <eol> and all hours after follow and find not aught <eol> here is that height of all love 's eminence <eol> where man may breathe but for a breathing space <eol> and feel his soul burn as an altar fire <eol> to the unknown god of unachieved desire <eol> and from the middle mystery of the place <eol> watch lights that break , hear sounds as of a quire <eol> but see not twice unveiled the veiled god 's face <eol>
