the wandering mariner , whose eye explores <eol> the wealthiest isles , the most enchanting shores <eol> views not a realm so bountiful and fair <eol> nor breathes the spirit of a purer air <eol> in every clime , the magnet of his soul <eol> touched by remembrance , trembles to that pole <eol> for in this land of heaven 's peculiar grace <eol> the heritage of nature 's noblest race <eol> there is a spot of earth supremely blest <eol> a dearer , sweeter spot than all the rest <eol> where man , creation 's tyrant , casts aside <eol> his sword and sceptre , pageantry and pride <eol> while , in his softened looks , benignly blend <eol> the sire , the son , the husband , brother , friend <eol>
