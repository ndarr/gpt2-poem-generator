how beautiful !— was this not one of eld <eol> that chaos on his boundless bosom held <eol> till earth came forward in a rush of storm <eol> closing his ribs upon her wingless form <eol> how beautiful !— the very lips do speak <eol> of love , and bid us worship : the pale cheek <eol> seems blushing through the marble — through the snow <eol> and the undrap'ried bosom feels a flow <eol> of fever on its brightness ; every vein <eol> at the blue pulse swells softly , like a chain <eol> of gentle hills . i would not fling a wreath <eol> of jewels on that brow , to flash beneath <eol> those queenly tresses ; for itself is more <eol> than sea born pearl of some elysian shore <eol>
