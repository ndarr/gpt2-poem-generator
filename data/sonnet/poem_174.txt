it may indeed be phantasy , when i <eol> essay to draw from all created things <eol> deep , heartfelt , inward joy that closely clings <eol> and trace in leaves and flowers that round me lie <eol> lessons of love and earnest piety <eol> so let it be ; and if the wide world rings <eol> in mock of this belief , it brings <eol> nor fear , nor grief , nor vain perplexity <eol> so will i build my altar in the fields <eol> and the blue sky my fretted dome shall be <eol> and the sweet fragrance that the wild flower yields <eol> shall be the incense i will yield to thee <eol> thee only god ! and thou shalt not despise <eol> even me , the priest of this poor sacrifice <eol>
