here is the place where loveliness keeps house <eol> between the river and the wooded hills <eol> within a valley where the springtime spills <eol> her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs <eol> where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows <eol> with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills <eol> her lap with asters ; and old winter frills <eol> with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse <eol> here you may meet with beauty . here she sits <eol> gazing upon the moon , or all the day <eol> tuning a wood thrush flute , remote , unseen <eol> or when the storm is out , ‘ tis she who flits <eol> from rock to rock , a form of flying spray <eol> shouting , beneath the leaves ’ tumultuous green <eol>
