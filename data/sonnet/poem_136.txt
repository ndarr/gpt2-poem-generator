go down to hell . this end is good to see <eol> the breath is lightened and the sense at ease <eol> because thou art not ; sense nor breath there is <eol> in what thy body was , whose soul shall be <eol> chief nerve of hell 's pained heart eternally <eol> thou art abolished from the midst of these <eol> that are what thou wast : pius from his knees <eol> blows off the dust that flecked them , bowed for thee <eol> yea , now the long tongued slack lipped litanies <eol> fail , and the priest has no more prayer to sell <eol> now the last jesuit found about thee is <eol> the beast that made thy fouler flesh his cell <eol> time lays his finger on thee , saying , â€œ cease <eol> here is no room for thee ; go down to hell <eol>
