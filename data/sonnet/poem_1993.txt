a face seen passing in a crowded street <eol> a voice heard singing music , large and free <eol> and from that moment life is changed , and we <eol> become of more heroic temper , meet <eol> to freely ask and give , a man complete <eol> radiant because of faith , we dare to be <eol> what nature meant us . brave idolatry <eol> which can conceive a hero ! no deceit <eol> no knowledge taught by unrelenting years <eol> can quench this fierce , untamable desire <eol> we know that what we long for once achieved <eol> will cease to satisfy . be still our fears <eol> if what we worship fail us , still the fire <eol> burns on , and it is much to have believed <eol>
