i go from colonnade to colonnade <eol> in streets that dante trod , and past the towers <eol> aslant toward heaven , and listen to the hours <eol> chimed by the bells of choirs where dante prayed <eol> they cease ; then lo ! the foot of time seems stayed <eol> five hundred years and more , i find me bowers <eol> where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers <eol> for one who reads boccaccio in the shade <eol> the cowl Ã¨ d students halt by two and threes <eol> to hear the voice come thrilling through the trees <eol> then tear themselves away to themes more trite <eol> anon i mark the diligent hands that turn <eol> unlovely parchment scrolls whereby to learn <eol> the beauty of inexorable right <eol>
