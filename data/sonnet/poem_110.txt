thus is his cheek the map of days outworn <eol> when beauty lived and died as flowers do now <eol> before these bastard signs of fair were born <eol> or durst inhabit on a living brow <eol> before the golden tresses of the dead <eol> the right of sepulchres , were shorn away <eol> to live a second life on second head <eol> ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay <eol> in him those holy antique hours are seen <eol> without all ornament , it self and true <eol> making no summer of another 's green <eol> robbing no old to dress his beauty new <eol> and him as for a map doth nature store <eol> to show false art what beauty was of yore <eol>
