yet , lady , no â€” for song so rude as mine <eol> chase not the wonders of your art divine <eol> still , radiant eye , upon the canvas dwell <eol> still , magic finger , weave your potent spell <eol> and , while i sing the animated smiles <eol> of fairy nature in these sun born isles <eol> oh , might the song awake some bright design <eol> inspire a touch , or prompt one happy line <eol> proud were my soul , to see its humble thought <eol> on painting 's mirror so divinely caught <eol> while wondering genius , as he leaned to trace <eol> the faint conception kindling into grace <eol> might love my numbers for the spark they threw <eol> and bless the lay that lent a charm to you <eol>
