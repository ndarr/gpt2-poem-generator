hear from me , long armed lord ! the makings five <eol> which go to every act , in sankhya taught <eol> as necessary . first the force ; and then <eol> the agent ; next , the various instruments <eol> fourth , the especial effort ; fifth , the god <eol> what work soever any mortal doth <eol> of body , mind , or speech , evil or good <eol> by these five doth he that . which being thus <eol> whoso , for lack of knowledge , seeth himself <eol> as the sole actor , knoweth nought at all <eol> and seeth nought . therefore , i say , if one <eol> holding aloof from self â€” with unstained mind <eol> should slay all yonder host , being bid to slay <eol> he doth not slay ; he is not bound thereby <eol>
