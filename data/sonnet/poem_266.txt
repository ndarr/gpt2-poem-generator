deep in the shady sadness of a vale <eol> far sunken from the healthy breath of morn <eol> far from the fiery noon , and eve 's one star <eol> sat gray hair 'd saturn , quiet as a stone <eol> still as the silence round about his lair <eol> forest on forest hung about his head <eol> like cloud on cloud . no stir of air was there <eol> not so much life as on a summer 's day <eol> robs not one light seed from the feather 'd grass <eol> but where the dead leaf fell , there did it rest <eol> a stream went voiceless by , still deadened more <eol> by reason of his fallen divinity <eol> spreading a shade : the naiad â€˜ mid her reeds <eol> press 'd her cold finger closer to her lips <eol>
