thou man of science , who , with practised eye <eol> and glance untiring sweep'st the starry sky <eol> speeding in thought along those trackless ways <eol> where planets burn and constellations blaze <eol> leaving uncounted worlds behind thee far <eol> listen — “ i am the bright and morning star <eol> he says — and does not thought more gladly stray <eol> where the meek herald of the rising day <eol> sits like a peaceful vestal bearing high <eol> her radiant urn on the soft eastern sky <eol> thence , rising , seek the morning star of heaven <eol> who to night 's myriad suns their light has given <eol> and , bowing low light 's sacred fount before <eol> in wondering , reverential awe adore <eol>
