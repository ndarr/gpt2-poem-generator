i lift my heavy heart up solemnly <eol> as once electra her sepulchral urn <eol> and , looking in thine eyes , i over turn <eol> the ashes at thy feet . behold and see <eol> what a great heap of grief lay hid in me <eol> and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn <eol> through the ashen greyness . if thy foot in scorn <eol> could tread them out to darkness utterly <eol> it might be well perhaps . but if instead <eol> thou wait beside me for the wind to blow <eol> the grey dust up , . . . those laurels on thine head <eol> o my beloved , will not shield thee so <eol> that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred <eol> the hair beneath . stand further off then ! go <eol>
