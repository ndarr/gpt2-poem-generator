to whom the swain : â€œ i hear and i obey <eol> but old laertes weeps his life away <eol> and deems thee lost : shall i speed employ <eol> to bless his age : a messenger of joy <eol> the mournful hour that tore his son away <eol> sent the sad sire in solitude to stray <eol> yet busied with his slaves , to ease his woe <eol> he dress 'd the vine , and bade the garden blow <eol> nor food nor wine refused ; but since the day <eol> that you to pylos plough 'd the watery way <eol> nor wine nor food he tastes ; but , sunk in woes <eol> wild springs the vine , no more the garden blows <eol> shut from the walks of men , to pleasure lost <eol> pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost <eol>
