charles ! my slow heart was only sad , when first <eol> i scanned that face of feeble infancy <eol> for dimly on my thoughtful spirit burst <eol> all i had been , and all my child might be <eol> but when i saw it on its mother 's arm <eol> and hanging at her bosom ( she the while <eol> bent o'er its features with a tearful smile <eol> then i was thrilled and melted , and most warm <eol> impressed a father 's kiss : and all beguiled <eol> of dark remembrance and presageful fear <eol> i seemed to see an angel form appear <eol> â€˜ twas even thine , beloved woman mild <eol> so for the mother 's sake the child was dear <eol> and dearer was the mother for the child <eol>
