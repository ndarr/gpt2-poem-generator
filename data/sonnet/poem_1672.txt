if tired of trees i seek again mankind <eol> well i know where to hie me — in the dawn <eol> to a slope where the cattle keep the lawn <eol> there amid lolling juniper reclined <eol> myself unseen , i see in white defined <eol> far off the homes of men , and farther still <eol> the graves of men on an opposing hill <eol> living or dead , whichever are to mind <eol> and if by moon i have too much of these <eol> i have but to turn on my arm , and lo <eol> the sun burned hillside sets my face aglow <eol> my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze <eol> i smell the earth , i smell the bruis è d plant <eol> i look into the crater of the ant <eol>
