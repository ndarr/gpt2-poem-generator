a shady nook where nought is overheard <eol> but wind among the eucalyptus leaves <eol> the cheery chirp of interflitting bird <eol> or wooden squeak of tree frog as it grieves <eol> the resting eye broods o'er the running grass <eol> or nodding gestures of the bowed wild oats <eol> watches the oleander lancers pass <eol> and the bright flashing of the oriole notes <eol> hushed are the senses with the drone of bees <eol> and the far glimmer of the mid day heat <eol> dreams stealing o'er one like the incoming seas <eol> soft as the rustling zephyrs in the wheat <eol> while on the breeze is borne the call of love <eol> to love , dear love , of majel , the wild dove <eol>
