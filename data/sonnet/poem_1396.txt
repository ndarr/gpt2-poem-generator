if i by gods , by heroes and by men <eol> be re assured , so that i not despair <eol> nor fear , pain , nor the impediments <eol> of death of body , joy and happiness <eol> yet must i learn to suffer and to feel <eol> and that i may my pathways clearly see <eol> let doubts arise , and dolour , and the woe <eol> of vanished hopes , of joy and all delight <eol> but if he should behold , should grant , and should attend <eol> my thoughts , my wishes , and my reasoning <eol> who makes them so uncertain , hot , and vague <eol> such dear conceits , such acts and speech <eol> will not be given nor done to him , who stays <eol> from birth , through life , to death in sheltered home <eol>
