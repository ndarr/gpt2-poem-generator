hard by the road , where on that little mound <eol> the high grass rustles to the passing breeze <eol> the child of misery rests her head in peace <eol> pause there in sadness . that unhallowed ground <eol> inshrines what once was isabel . sleep on <eol> sleep on , poor outcast ! lovely was thy cheek <eol> and thy mild eye was eloquent to speak <eol> the soul of pity . pale and woe begone <eol> soon did thy fair cheek fade , and thine eye weep <eol> the tear of anguish for the babe unborn <eol> the helpless heir of poverty and scorn <eol> she drank the draught that chill 'd her soul to sleep <eol> i pause and wipe the big drop from mine eye <eol> whilst the proud levite scowls and passes by <eol>
