o child of mine , my little son , alas <eol> beneath the sunlight of thy gentle eyes <eol> too soon , too soon , what fateful shadows rise <eol> like night foretold in some sweet woodland glass <eol> on tender feet that scarcely bow the grass <eol> what stains are those of ripe pomegranate dyes <eol> when on my breast thy head in slumber lies <eol> what thorns are those that through my heart do pass <eol> and round about these crowds of haunting forms <eol> that burn their splendor through my dimmest dreams <eol> o little child , thou wonder too divine <eol> thy precious body all my bosom warms <eol> with mine own blood , but oftentimes it seems <eol> too dearly loved ,â€” that yet thou art not mine <eol>
