with all the fairest angels nearest god <eol> the ineffable true of heart around the throne <eol> there shall i find you waiting when the flown <eol> dream leaves my heart insentient as the clod <eol> and when the grief retracing ways i trod <eol> become a shining path to thee alone <eol> my weary feet , that seemed to drag as stone <eol> shall once again , with wings of fleetness shod <eol> fare on , beloved , to find you ! just beyond <eol> the seraph throng await me , standing near <eol> the gentler angels , eager and apart <eol> be there , near god 's own fairest , with the fond <eol> sweet smile that was your own , and let me hear <eol> your voice again and clasp you to my heart <eol>
