within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush <eol> that overhung a molehill large and round <eol> i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush <eol> sing hymns to sunrise , and i drank the sound <eol> with joy ; and , often an intruding guest <eol> i watched her secret toils from day to day <eol> how true she warped the moss , to form a nest <eol> and modelled it within with wood and clay <eol> and by and by , like heath bells gilt with dew <eol> there lay her shining eggs , as bright as flowers <eol> ink spotted over shells of greeny blue <eol> and there i witnessed in the sunny hours <eol> a brood of nature 's minstrels chirp and fly <eol> glad as that sunshine and the laughing sky <eol>
