many in aftertimes will say of you <eol> “ he loved her ” — while of me what will they say <eol> not that i loved you more than just in play <eol> for fashion 's sake as idle women do <eol> even let them prate ; who know not what we knew <eol> of love and parting in exceeding pain <eol> of parting hopeless here to meet again <eol> hopeless on earth , and heaven is out of view <eol> but by my heart of love laid bare to you <eol> my love that you can make not void nor vain <eol> love that foregoes you but to claim anew <eol> beyond this passage of the gate of death <eol> i charge you at the judgment make it plain <eol> my love of you was life and not a breath <eol>
