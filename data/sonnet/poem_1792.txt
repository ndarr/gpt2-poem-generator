let me not to the marriage of true minds <eol> admit impediments . love is not love <eol> which alters when it alteration finds <eol> or bends with the remover to remove <eol> o , no ! it is an ever fixed mark <eol> that looks on tempests and is never shaken <eol> it is the star to every wandering bark <eol> whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken <eol> love 's not time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks <eol> within his bending sickle 's compass come <eol> love alters not with his brief hours and weeks <eol> but bears it out even to the edge of doom <eol> if this be error and upon me proved <eol> i never writ , nor no man ever loved <eol>
