how do i keep thee ? let me count the ways <eol> i bar up every breadth and depth and height <eol> my hands can reach , while feeling out of sight <eol> for bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise <eol> i keep thee from the public 's idle gaze <eol> i keep thee in , by sun or candle light <eol> i keep thee , rude , as women strive for right <eol> i keep thee boldly , as they seek for praise <eol> i keep thee with more effort than i 'd use <eol> to keep a dry goods shop or big hotel <eol> i keep thee with a power i seemed to lose <eol> with that last cook . i 'll keep thee down the well <eol> or up the chimney place ! or if i choose <eol> i shall but keep thee in a pumpkin shell <eol>
