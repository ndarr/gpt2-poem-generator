so late in autumn half the world 's asleep <eol> and half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale <eol> for dampness now , not freshness , rides the gale <eol> and cold and colorless comes ashore the deep <eol> with tides that bluster or with tides that creep <eol> now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil <eol> of fog , not sultry haze ; and blight and bale <eol> have done their worst , and leaves rot on the heap <eol> so late in autumn one forgets the spring <eol> forgets the summer with its opulence <eol> the callow birds that long have found a wing <eol> the swallows that more lately gat them hence <eol> will anything like spring , will anything <eol> like summer , rouse one day the slumbering sense <eol>
