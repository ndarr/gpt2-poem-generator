such prayers last year were put up for thy sake <eol> what shall this year do that hath lived to see <eol> the piteous and unpitied end of thee <eol> what moan , what cry , what clamour shall it make <eol> seeing as a reed breaks all thine empire break <eol> and all thy great strength as a rotten tree <eol> whose branches made broad night from sea to sea <eol> and the world shuddered when a leaf would shake <eol> from the unknown deep wherein those prayers were heard <eol> from the dark height of time there sounds a word <eol> crying , comfort ; though death ride on this red hour <eol> hope waits with eyes that make the morning dim <eol> till liberty , reclothed with love and power <eol> shall pass and know not if she tread on him <eol>
