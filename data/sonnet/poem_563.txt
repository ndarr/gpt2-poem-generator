i lift mine eyes , and all the windows blaze <eol> with forms of saints and holy men who died <eol> here martyred and hereafter glorified <eol> and the great rose upon its leaves displays <eol> christ 's triumph , and the angelic roundelays <eol> with splendor upon splendor multiplied <eol> and beatrice again at dante 's side <eol> no more rebukes , but smiles her words of praise <eol> and then the organ sounds , and unseen choirs <eol> sing the old latin hymns of peace and love <eol> and benedictions of the holy ghost <eol> and the melodious bells among the spires <eol> o'er all the house tops and through heaven above <eol> proclaim the elevation of the host <eol>
