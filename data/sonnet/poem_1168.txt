i stood amazed , and saw my licia shine <eol> fairer than phoebus , in his brightest pride <eol> set forth in colors by a hand divine <eol> where naught was wanting but a soul to guide <eol> it was a picture , that i could descry <eol> yet made with art so as it seemed to live <eol> surpassing fair , and yet it had no eye <eol> whereof my senses could no reason give <eol> with that the painter bid me not to muse <eol> â€œ her eyes are shut , but i deserve no blame <eol> for if she saw , in faith , it could not choose <eol> but that the work had wholly been a flame <eol> then burn me , sweet , with brightness of your eyes <eol> that phoenix like from thence i may arise <eol>
