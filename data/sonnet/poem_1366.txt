here now is winter . winter , after all <eol> is not so drear as was my boding dream <eol> while autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam <eol> on sapless leafage too inert to fall <eol> still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall <eol> where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam <eol> still here a bud and there a blossom seem <eol> hopeful , and robin still is musical <eol> leaves , flowers and fruit and one delightful song <eol> remain ; these days are short , but now the nights <eol> intense and long , hang out their utmost lights <eol> such starry nights are long , yet not too long <eol> frost nips the weak , while strengthening still the strong <eol> against that day when spring sets all to rights <eol>
