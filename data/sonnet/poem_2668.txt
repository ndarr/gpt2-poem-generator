while i gazed at that fair one 's cheek , a shade <eol> of thought or care stole softly over <eol> like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made <eol> looking down on a field of blossoming clover <eol> the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush <eol> had something lost of its brilliant blush <eol> and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels <eol> that marched so calmly round above her <eol> was a little dimmed ,— as when evening steals <eol> upon noon 's hot face . yet one could n't but love her <eol> for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay <eol> rocked on her breast , as she swung all day <eol> and she seemed , in the same silver tone , to say <eol> “ passing away ! passing away <eol>
