ye heralds of my heart , mine ardent groans <eol> o tears which gladly would burst out to brooks <eol> oh spent on fruitless sand my surging moans <eol> oh thoughts enthralled unto care boding looks <eol> ah just laments of my unjust distress <eol> ah fond desires whom reason could not guide <eol> oh hopes of love that intimate redress <eol> yet prove the load stars unto bad betide <eol> when will you cease ? or shall pain never ceasing <eol> seize oh my heart ? oh mollify your rage <eol> lest your assaults with over swift increasing <eol> procure my death , or call on timeless age <eol> what if they do ? they shall but feed the fire <eol> which i have kindled by my fond desire <eol>
