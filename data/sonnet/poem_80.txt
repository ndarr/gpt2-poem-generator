oh pleasing thoughts , apprentices of love <eol> fore runners of desire , sweet mithridates <eol> the poison of my sorrows to remove <eol> with whom my hopes and fear full oft debates <eol> enrich yourselves and me by your self riches <eol> which are the thoughts you spend on heaven bred beauty <eol> rouse you my muse beyond our poets ’ pitches <eol> and , working wonders , yet say all is duty <eol> use you no eaglets ’ eyes , nor phoenix ’ feathers <eol> to tower the heaven from whence heaven 's wonder sallies <eol> for why ? your sun sings sweetly to her weathers <eol> making a spring of winter in the valleys <eol> show to the world though poor and scant my skill is <eol> how sweet thoughts be , that are but thought on phillis <eol>
