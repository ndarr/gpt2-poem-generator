she blessed them , and with voices lifted up <eol> in loud lament the dregs of sorrow 's cup <eol> they drained together . orpah , weeping , turned <eol> and slowly went , but ruth with eyes that yearned <eol> into naomi 's , cried aloud in pain <eol> â€œ thus to forsake thee , urge me not again <eol> nor to return from following after thee <eol> for where thou goest , i will surely go <eol> and where thou lodgest , will i lodge also <eol> thy people shall be my people evermore <eol> and thy god only will i now adore <eol> and where thou diest , i will buried be <eol> so may jehovah strike me with his thunder <eol> if aught but only death our lives shall sunder <eol>
