as the bright flowers start from their wintry tomb <eol> i 've sprung from the depths of futurity 's gloom <eol> with the glory of hope on my unshadowed brow <eol> but a fear at my heart , earth welcomes me now <eol> i come and bear with me a measureless flow <eol> of infinite joy and of infinite woe <eol> the banquet 's light jest and the penitent prayer <eol> the sweet laugh of gladness , the wail of despair <eol> the warm words of welcome , and broken farewell <eol> the strains of rich music , the funeral knell <eol> the fair bridal wreath , and the robe for the dead <eol> o how will they meet in the path i shall tread <eol> o how will they mingle where'er i pass by <eol> as sunshine and storm in the rainbow on high <eol>
