one spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep <eol> of human minds , that shakes the elms in storm <eol> that sings in passionate music , or on warm <eol> still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep <eol> of thistle seeds that wait a travelling wind <eol> one spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought <eol> and the long thundering seas ; the soul is wrought <eol> of one stuff with the body â€” matter and mind <eol> woven together in so close a mesh <eol> that flowers may blossom into a song , that flesh <eol> may strangely teach the loveliest holiest things <eol> to watching spirits . truth is brought to birth <eol> not in some vacant heaven : its beauty springs <eol> from the dear bosom of material earth <eol>
