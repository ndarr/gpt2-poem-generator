and therefore if to love can be desert <eol> i am not all unworthy . cheeks as pale <eol> as these you see , and trembling knees that fail <eol> to bear the burden of a heavy heart <eol> this weary minstrel life that once was girt <eol> to climb aornus , and can scarce avail <eol> to pipe now ‘ gainst the valley nightingale <eol> a melancholy music ,— why advert <eol> to these things ? o beloved , it is plain <eol> i am not of thy worth nor for thy place <eol> and yet , because i love thee , i obtain <eol> from that same love this vindicating grace <eol> to live on still in love , and yet in vain <eol> to bless thee , yet renounce thee to thy face <eol>
