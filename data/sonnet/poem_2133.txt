if laura — lady of the flower soft face <eol> should light upon these verses , she may take <eol> the tenderest line , and through its pulses trace <eol> what man can suffer for a woman 's sake <eol> for in the nights that burn , the days that break <eol> a thin pale figure stands in passion 's place <eol> and peace comes not , nor yet the perished grace <eol> of youth , to keep old faiths and fires awake <eol> ah ! marvellous maid . life sobs , and sighing saith <eol> “ she left me , fleeting like a fluttered dove <eol> but i would have a moment of her breath <eol> so i might taste the sweetest sense thereof <eol> and catch from blossoming , honeyed lips of love <eol> some faint , some fair , some dim , delicious death <eol>
