if thou hadst been a poet ! on my heart <eol> the thought dashed . it recoiled , as , with the gift <eol> light blinded , and joy saddened , so bereft <eol> and the hot fountain tears , with sudden start <eol> thronged to mine eyes , as if with that same smart <eol> the husk of vision had in twain been cleft <eol> its hidden soul in naked beauty left <eol> and we beheld thee , nature , as thou art <eol> o poet , poet , poet ! at thy feet <eol> i should have lien , sainted with listening <eol> my pulses answering aye , in rhythmic beat <eol> each parting word that with melodious wing <eol> moved on , creating still my being sweet <eol> my soul thy harp , thy word the quivering string <eol>
