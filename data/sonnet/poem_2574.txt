friend of my peaceful days ! substantial friend <eol> whom wealth can never change , nor int'rest bend <eol> i love thee like a child . thou wert to me <eol> the dumb companion of my misery <eol> and oftner of my joys ;â€” then as i spoke <eol> i shar 'd thy sympathy , old heart of oak <eol> for surely when my labour ceas 'd at night <eol> with trembling , feverish hands , and aching sight <eol> the draught that cheer 'd me and subdu 'd my care <eol> on thy broad shoulders thou wert proud to bear <eol> o'er thee , with expectation 's fire elate <eol> i 've sat and ponder 'd on my future fate <eol> on thee , with winter muffins for thy store <eol> i 've lean 'd , and quite forgot that i was poor <eol>
