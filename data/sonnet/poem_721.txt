to one who has been long in city pent <eol> ‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair <eol> and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer <eol> full in the smile of the blue firmament <eol> who is more happy , when , with heart 's content <eol> fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair <eol> of wavy grass , and reads a debonair <eol> and gentle tale of love and languishment <eol> returning home at evening , with an ear <eol> catching the notes of philomel ,— and eye <eol> watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career <eol> he mourns that day so soon has glided by <eol> e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear <eol> that falls through the clear ether silently <eol>
