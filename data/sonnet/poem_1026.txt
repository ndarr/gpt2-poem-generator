victorious through failure ! faithful lord <eol> who for twelve angel legions wouldst not pray <eol> from thine own country of eternal day <eol> to shield thee from the lanterned traitor horde <eol> making thy one rash servant sheathe his sword <eol> our long retarded legions , on their way <eol> toiling through sands , and shouldering nile 's down sway <eol> to reach thy soldier , keeping at thy word <eol> thou sawest foiled â€” but glorifiedst him <eol> over ten cities giving him thy rule <eol> we will not mourn a star that grew not dim <eol> a soldier child of god gone home from school <eol> a dregless cup , with life brimmed , he did quaff <eol> and quaffs it now with christ 's imperial staff <eol>
