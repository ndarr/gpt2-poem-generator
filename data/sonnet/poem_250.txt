my love amazed did blush herself to see <eol> pictured by art , all naked as she was <eol> â€œ how could the painter know so much by me <eol> or art effect what he hath brought to pass <eol> it is not like he naked me hath seen <eol> or stood so nigh for to observe so much <eol> no , sweet ; his eyes so near have never been <eol> nor could his hands by art have cunning such <eol> i showed my heart , wherein you printed were <eol> you , naked you , as here you painted are <eol> in that my love your picture i must wear <eol> and show't to all , unless you have more care <eol> then take my heart , and place it with your own <eol> so shall you naked never more be known <eol>
