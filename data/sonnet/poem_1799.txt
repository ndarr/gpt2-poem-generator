when i behold this tickle * trustles state <eol> of vaine worlds glorie , flitting too and fro <eol> and mortall men tossed by troublous fate <eol> in restles seas of wretchednes and woe <eol> i wish i might this wearie life forgoe <eol> and shortly turne unto my happie rest <eol> where my free spirite might not anie moe <eol> be vest with sights that doo her peace molest <eol> and ye , faire ladie , in whose bounteous brest <eol> all heavenly grace and vertue shrined is <eol> when ye these rythmes doo read , and vew the rest <eol> loath this base world , and thinke of heavens blis <eol> and though ye be the fairest of gods creatures <eol> yet thinke that death shall spoyle your goodly features <eol>
