i think of thee !— my thoughts do twine and bud <eol> about thee , as wild vines , about a tree <eol> put out broad leaves , and soon there 's nought to see <eol> except the straggling green which hides the wood <eol> yet , o my palm tree , be it understood <eol> i will not have my thoughts instead of thee <eol> who art dearer , better ! rather , instantly <eol> renew thy presence ; as a strong tree should <eol> rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare <eol> and let these bands of greenery which insphere thee <eol> drop heavily down ,— burst , shattered everywhere <eol> because , in this deep joy to see and hear thee <eol> and breathe within thy shadow a new air <eol> i do not think of thee — i am too near thee <eol>
