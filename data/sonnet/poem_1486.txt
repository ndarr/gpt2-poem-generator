when i do count the clock that tells the time <eol> and see the brave day sunk in hideous night <eol> when i behold the violet past prime <eol> and sable curls all silvered o'er with white <eol> when lofty trees i see barren of leaves <eol> which erst from heat did canopy the herd <eol> and summer 's green all girded up in sheaves <eol> borne on the bier with white and bristly beard <eol> then of thy beauty do i question make <eol> that thou among the wastes of time must go <eol> since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake <eol> and die as fast as they see others grow <eol> and nothing â€˜ gainst time 's scythe can make defence <eol> save breed to brave him , when he takes thee hence <eol>
