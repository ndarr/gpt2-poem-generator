the face of all the world is changed , i think <eol> since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul <eol> move still , oh , still , beside me , as they stole <eol> betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink <eol> of obvious death , where i , who thought to sink <eol> was caught up into love , and taught the whole <eol> of life in a new rhythm . the cup of dole <eol> god gave for baptism , i am fain to drink <eol> and praise its sweetness , sweet , with thee anear <eol> the names of country , heaven , are changed away <eol> for where thou art or shalt be , there or here <eol> and this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday <eol> ( the singing angels know ) are only dear <eol> because thy name moves right in what they say <eol>
