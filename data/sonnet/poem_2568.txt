who will believe my verse in time to come <eol> if it were filled with your most high deserts <eol> though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb <eol> which hides your life , and shows not half your parts <eol> if i could write the beauty of your eyes <eol> and in fresh numbers number all your graces <eol> the age to come would say this poet lies <eol> such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces <eol> so should my papers ( yellowed with their age <eol> be scorned , like old men of less truth than tongue <eol> and your true rights be termed a poet 's rage <eol> and stretched metre of an antique song <eol> but were some child of yours alive that time <eol> you should live twice in it , and in my rhyme <eol>
