in sunday school engaged twice each lord 's day <eol> and hearing three discourses , some would say <eol> no time could then remain for aught beside <eol> but this , my friends , has only to be tried <eol> for cooper , in reserve , two hours still kept <eol> an elder 's invitation to accept <eol> him to accompany to his home , and there <eol> join in sweet conversation , hymn or prayer <eol> thus mostly passed his sabbaths for two years <eol> which kept him free from many doubts and fears <eol> enabled him to work at business still <eol> with easy mind , and with right hearty will <eol> and find that wisdom 's ways are pleasantness <eol> while all her paths are peace and heart felt bliss <eol>
