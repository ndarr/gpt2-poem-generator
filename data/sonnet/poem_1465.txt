above the spring tide sundawn of the year <eol> a sunlike star , not born of day or night <eol> filled the fair heaven of spring with heavenlier light <eol> made of all ages orbed in one sole sphere <eol> whose light was as a titan 's smile or tear <eol> then rose a ray more flowerlike , starry white <eol> like a child 's eye grown lovelier with delight <eol> sweet as a child 's heart lightening laugh to hear <eol> and last a fire from heaven , a fiery rain <eol> as of god 's wrath on the unclean cities , fell <eol> and lit the shuddering shades of half seen hell <eol> that shrank before it and were cloven in twain <eol> a beacon fired by lightning , whence all time <eol> sees red the bare black ruins of a crime <eol>
