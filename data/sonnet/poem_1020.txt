thou , from the first , unborn , undying love <eol> albeit we gaze not on thy glories near <eol> before the face of god didst breath and move <eol> though night and pain and ruin and death reign here <eol> thou foldest , like a golden atmosphere <eol> the very throne of the eternal god <eol> passing through thee the edicts of his fear <eol> are mellowed into music , borne abroad <eol> by the loud winds , though they uprend the sea <eol> even from his central deeps : thine empery <eol> is over all : thou wilt not brook eclipse <eol> thou goest and returnest to his lips <eol> like lightning : thou dost ever brood above <eol> the silence of all hearts , unutterable love <eol>
