ah pale and dying infant of the spring <eol> how rightly now do i resemble thee <eol> that selfsame hand that thee from stalk did wring <eol> hath rent my breast and robbed my heart from me <eol> yet shalt thou live . for why ? thy native vigour <eol> shall thrive by woeful dew drops of my dolor <eol> and from the wounds i bear through fancy 's rigour <eol> my streaming blood shall yield the crimson color <eol> the ravished sighs that ceaseless take their issue <eol> from out the furnace of my heart inflamed <eol> to yield you lasting springs shall never miss you <eol> so by my plaints and pains , you shall be famed <eol> let my heart 's heat and cold , thy crimson nourish <eol> and by my sorrows let thy beauty flourish <eol>
