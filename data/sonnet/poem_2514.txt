why dost thou , delia , credit so thy glass <eol> gazing thy beauty deigned thee by the skies <eol> and dost not rather look on him , alas <eol> whose state best shows the force of murdering eyes <eol> the broken tops of lofty trees declare <eol> the fury of a mercy wanting storm <eol> and of what force thy wounding graces are <eol> upon myself , you best may find the form <eol> then leave thy glass , and gaze thyself on me <eol> that mirror shows what power is in thy face <eol> to view your form too much may danger be <eol> narcissus changed t'a flower in such a case <eol> and you are changed , but not t'a hyacinth <eol> i fear your eye hath turned your heart to flint <eol>
