beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown <eol> blue and bright colored for our dim and green <eol> beyond the lands we see , stretch lands unseen <eol> with many tinted tangle overgrown <eol> and icebound seas there are like seas of stone <eol> serenely stormless as death lies serene <eol> and lifeless tracks of sand , which intervene <eol> betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown <eol> this dead and living world befits our case <eol> who live and die : we live in wearied hope <eol> we die in hope not dead ; we run a race <eol> to day , and find no present halting place <eol> all things we see lie far within our scope <eol> and still we peer beyond with craving face <eol>
