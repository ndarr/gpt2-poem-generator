ye too , dim watchfires of some darkling hour <eol> whose fame forlorn time saves not nor proclaims <eol> for ever , but forgetfulness defames <eol> and darkness and the shadow of death devour <eol> lift up ye too your light , put forth your power <eol> let the far twilight feel your soft small flames <eol> and smile , albeit night name not even their names <eol> ghost by ghost passing , flower blown down on flower <eol> that sweet tongued shadow , like a star 's that passed <eol> singing , and light was from its darkness cast <eol> to paint the face of painting fair with praise <eol> and that wherein forefigured smiles the pure <eol> fraternal face of wordsworth 's elidure <eol> between two child faced masks of merrier days <eol>
