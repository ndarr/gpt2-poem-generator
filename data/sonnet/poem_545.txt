sweet hand , the sweet but cruel bow thou art <eol> from whence at me five ivory arrows fly <eol> so with five wounds at once i wounded lie <eol> bearing my breast the print of every dart <eol> saint francis had the like , yet felt no smart <eol> where i in living torments never die <eol> his wounds were in his hands and feet ; where i <eol> all these five helpless wounds feel in my heart <eol> now , as saint francis , if a saint am i <eol> the bow that shot these shafts a relic is <eol> i mean the hand , which is the reason why <eol> so many for devotion thee would kiss <eol> and some thy glove kiss as a thing divine <eol> this arrows â€™ quiver , and this relic 's shrine <eol>
