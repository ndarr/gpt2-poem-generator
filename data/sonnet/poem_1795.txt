who will believe my verse in time to come <eol> if it were fill 'd with your most high deserts <eol> though yet , heaven knows , it is but as a tomb <eol> which hides your life and shows not half your parts <eol> if i could write the beauty of your eyes <eol> and in fresh numbers number all your graces <eol> the age to come would say â€˜ this poet lies <eol> such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces <eol> so should my papers , yellowed with their age <eol> be scorn 'd , like old men of less truth than tongue <eol> and your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage <eol> and stretched metre of an antique song <eol> but were some child of yours alive that time <eol> you should live twice , in it and in my rhyme <eol>
