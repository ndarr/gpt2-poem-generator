the everlasting grass — how bright , how cool <eol> the day has gone too suddenly , too soon <eol> there 's something white and shiny in that pool <eol> throw in a stone , and you will hit the moon <eol> listen , the church bell ringing ! do not say <eol> we must go back to morrow to our work <eol> we 'll tell them we are dead : we died to day <eol> we 're lazy . we 're too happy . we will shirk <eol> we 're cows . we 're kettles . we 'll be anything <eol> except the manikins of time and fear <eol> we 'll start away to morrow wandering <eol> and nobody will notice in a year <eol> now the great sun is slipping under ground <eol> grip firmly !— how the earth is whirling round <eol>
