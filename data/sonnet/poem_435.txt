one of my wishes is that those dark trees <eol> so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze <eol> were not , as â€˜ twere , the merest mask of gloom <eol> but stretched away unto the edge of doom <eol> i should not be withheld but that some day <eol> into their vastness i should steal away <eol> fearless of ever finding open land <eol> or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand <eol> i do not see why i should e'er turn back <eol> or those should not set forth upon my track <eol> to overtake me , who should miss me here <eol> and long to know if still i held them dear <eol> they would not find me changed from him they knew <eol> only more sure of all i thought was true <eol>
