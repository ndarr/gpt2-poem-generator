what a night ! the wind howls , hisses , and but stops <eol> to howl more loud , while the snow volley keeps <eol> incessant batter at the window pane <eol> making our comfort feel as sweet again <eol> and in the morning , when the tempest drops <eol> at every cottage door mountainous heaps <eol> of snow lie drifted , that all entrance stops <eol> untill the beesom and the shovel gain <eol> the path , and leave a wall on either side <eol> the shepherd rambling valleys white and wide <eol> with new sensations his old memory fills <eol> when hedges left at night , no more descried <eol> are turned to one white sweep of curving hills <eol> and trees turned bushes half their bodies hide <eol>
