the birds sung their sorrows the whole summer long <eol> and the robin first mixed up his ills with his song <eol> he sung of his griefs — how in love he 'd been crossed <eol> and gave up his heart as eternally lost <eol> ‘ t was burnt to a coal , as sly cupid let fall <eol> a spark that scorched through both the feathers and all <eol> to cure it time tried , but ne'er found out the way <eol> so the mark on his bosom he wears to this day <eol> and when birds are all silent , and not a leaf seen <eol> on the trees , but the ivy and holly so green <eol> in frost and in snow little robin will sing <eol> to put off the sorrow that ruffles his wing <eol> and that is the cause in our gardens we hear <eol> the robin 's sweet note at the close of the year <eol>
