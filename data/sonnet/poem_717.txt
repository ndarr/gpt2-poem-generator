there had been phantoms , pale remembered shapes <eol> of this and this occasion , sisterly <eol> in their resemblances , each effigy <eol> crowned with the same bright hair above the nape 's <eol> white rounded firmness , and each body alert <eol> with such swift loveliness , that very rest <eol> seemed a poised movement : ... phantoms that impressed <eol> but a faint influence and could bless or hurt <eol> no more than dreams . and these ghost things were she <eol> for formless still , without identity <eol> not one she seemed , not clear , but many and dim <eol> one face among the legions of the street <eol> indifferent mystery , she was for him <eol> something still uncreated , incomplete <eol>
