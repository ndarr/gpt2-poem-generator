o steep and rugged life , whose harsh ascent <eol> slopes blindly upward through the bitter night <eol> they say that on thy summit , high in light <eol> sweet rest awaits the climber , travel spent <eol> but i , alas , with dusty garments rent <eol> with fainting heart and failing limbs and sight <eol> can see no glimmer of the shining height <eol> and vainly list , with body forward bent <eol> to catch athwart the gloom one wandering note <eol> of those glad anthems which ( they say ) are sung <eol> when one emerges from the mists below <eol> but though , o life , thy summit be remote <eol> and all thy stony path with darkness hung <eol> yet ever upward through the night i go <eol>
