the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed <eol> and on the church yard by the road , i know <eol> it falls as white and noiselessly as snow <eol> â€˜ twas such a night two weary summers fled <eol> the stars , as now , were waning overhead <eol> listen ! again the shrill lipped bugles blow <eol> where the swift currents of the river flow <eol> past fredericksburg : far off the heavens are red <eol> with sudden conflagration : on yon height <eol> linstock in hand , the gunners hold their breath <eol> a signal rocket pierces the dense night <eol> flings its spent stars upon the town beneath <eol> hark ! the artillery massing on the right <eol> hark ! the black squadrons wheeling down to death <eol>
