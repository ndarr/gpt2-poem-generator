no sooner on my vision streaming , smote <eol> the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en <eol> in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i <eol> turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe <eol> that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast <eol> if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe <eol> and would have cried : â€œ there is no dram of blood <eol> that doth not quiver in me . the old flame <eol> throws out clear tokens of reviving fire <eol> but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself <eol> virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he <eol> to whom i gave me up for safety : nor <eol> all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save <eol> my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears <eol>
