cover thine eyes and weep , o child of hell <eol> grey spouse of satan , church of name abhorred <eol> weep , withered harlot , with thy weeping lord <eol> now none will buy the heaven thou hast to sell <eol> at price of prostituted souls , and swell <eol> thy loveless list of lovers . fire and sword <eol> no more are thine : the steel , the wheel , the cord <eol> the flames that rose round living limbs , and fell <eol> in lifeless ash and ember , now no more <eol> approve thee godlike . rome , redeemed at last <eol> from all the red pollution of thy past <eol> acclaims the grave bright face that smiled of yore <eol> even on the fire that caught it round and clomb <eol> to cast its ashes on the face of rome <eol>
