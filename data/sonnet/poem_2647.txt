needs must i leave and yet needs must i love <eol> in vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe <eol> despair in me , disdain in thee , doth show <eol> how by my wit i do my folly prove <eol> all this my heart from love can never move <eol> love is not in my heart . no , lady , no <eol> my heart is love itself . till i forego <eol> my heart i never can my love remove <eol> how can i then leave love ? i do intend <eol> not to crave grace , but yet to wish it still <eol> not to praise thee , but beauty to commend <eol> and so , by beauty 's praise , praise thee i will <eol> for as my heart is love , love not in me <eol> so beauty thou , beauty is not in thee <eol>
