whenas my love lay sickly in her bed <eol> pale death did post in hope to have a prey <eol> but she so spotless made him that he fled <eol> “ unmeet to die , ” she cried , and could not stay <eol> back he retired , and thus the heavens he told <eol> “ all things that are , are subject unto me <eol> both towns , and men , and what the world doth hold <eol> but her fair licia still immortal be <eol> the heavens did grant ; a goddess she was made <eol> immortal , fair , unfit to suffer change <eol> so now she lives , and never more shall fade <eol> in earth a goddess , what can be more strange <eol> then will i hope , a goddess and so near <eol> she cannot choose my sighs and prayers but hear <eol>
