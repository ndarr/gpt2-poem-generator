fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair <eol> her brow shades frown , although her eyes are sunny <eol> her smiles are lightning , though her pride despair <eol> and her disdains are gall , her favours honey <eol> a modest maid , deck 'd with a blush of honour <eol> whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love <eol> the wonder of all eyes that look upon her <eol> sacred on earth ; design 'd a saint above <eol> chastity and beauty , which are deadly foes <eol> live reconciled friends within her brow <eol> and had she pity to conjoin with those <eol> then who had heard the plaints i utter now <eol> for had she not been fair , and thus unkind <eol> my muse had slept , and none had known my mind <eol>
