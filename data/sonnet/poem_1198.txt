â€œ i 'll come to that in time , if you 'll be still <eol> well , so the bishop left , and in six weeks <eol> or somewhere there , i started for montreaux <eol> to meet the bishop . shipped ahead my trunk <eol> to jaffa as the bishop did . but now <eol> i must tell you my dream . the night before <eol> i reached montreaux i had a wondrous dream <eol> i saw the bishop on the station platform <eol> his face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing <eol> his gold head cane . and sure enough next day <eol> as i stepped from the train i saw the bishop <eol> his face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing <eol> his gold head cane . and i thought something wrong <eol> and still i did n't act upon the thought <eol>
