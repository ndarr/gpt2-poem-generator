i christened you in happier days , before <eol> these gray forebodings on my brow were seen <eol> you are still lovely in your new leaved green <eol> the brimming river soothes his grassy shore <eol> the bridge is there ; the rock with lichens hoar <eol> and the same shadows on the water lean <eol> outlasting us . how many graves between <eol> that day and this ! how many shadows more <eol> darken my heart , their substance from these eyes <eol> hidden forever ! so our world is made <eol> of life and death commingled ; and the sighs <eol> outweigh the smiles , in equal balance laid <eol> what compensation ? none , save that the allwise <eol> so schools us to love things that cannot fade <eol>
