how can i thank thee for this gift of thine <eol> digby , the dawn and day star of our age <eol> forerunner thou of many a saint and sage <eol> who since have fought and conquer 'd ‘ neath the sign <eol> thou hast left , as in a sacred shrine <eol> what shrine more pure than thy unspotted page <eol> the priceless relics , as a heritage <eol> of loftiest thoughts and lessons most divine <eol> poet and teacher of sublimest lore <eol> thou scornest not the painter 's mimic skill <eol> and thus hath come , obedient to thy will <eol> the outward form that calderon 's spirit wore <eol> ah ! happy canvas that two glories fill <eol> where calderon lives ‘ neath digby 's hand once more <eol>
