say what you will , there is not in the world <eol> a nobler sight than from this upper down <eol> no rugged landscape here , no beauty hurled <eol> from its creator 's hand as with a frown <eol> but a green plain on which green hills look down <eol> trim as a garden plot . no other hue <eol> can hence be seen , save here and there the brown <eol> of a square fallow , and the horizon 's blue <eol> dear checker work of woods , the sussex weald <eol> if a name thrills me yet of things of earth <eol> that name is thine ! how often i have fled <eol> to thy deep hedgerows and embraced each field <eol> each lag , each pasture ,â€” fields which gave me birth <eol> and saw my youth , and which must hold me dead <eol>
