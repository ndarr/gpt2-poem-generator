delight in your bright eyes my death did breed <eol> as light and glittering weapons babes allure <eol> to play with fire and sword , and so procure <eol> then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed <eol> thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed <eol> yet shall my ashes and my blood assure <eol> thy beauty 's fame forever to endure <eol> for thy fame 's life from my death doth proceed <eol> because my heart to ashes burn Ã¨ d giveth <eol> life to thy fame , thou right a phoenix art <eol> and like a pelican thy beauty liveth <eol> by sucking blood out of my breast and heart <eol> lo why with wonder we may thee compare <eol> unto the pelican and phoenix rare <eol>
