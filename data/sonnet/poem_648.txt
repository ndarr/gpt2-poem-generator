strong son of fergus , with thy latest breath <eol> thou hast lent a joy unto the funeral knell <eol> welcoming with thy whispered â€œ all is well <eol> the awful aspect of the angel death <eol> as , strong in life , thou couldst not brook to shun <eol> the heat and burthen of the fiery day <eol> fronting defeat with stalwart undismay <eol> and wearing meekly honours stoutly won <eol> pure lips , pure hands , pure heart were thine , as aye <eol> erin demanded from her bards of old <eol> and , therefore , on thy harpstrings of pure gold <eol> has waked once more her high heroic lay <eol> what shoulders now shall match the mighty fold <eol> of ossian 's mantle ? thou hast passed away <eol>
