oh ! stars , that through the darkness smile and gleam <eol> like glory rays that gild the dreary gloom <eol> or like some soul world glance or mystic dream <eol> that from the mind 's vast store of summer bloom <eol> we feel at times â€” your influence comes to raise <eol> our hearts above earth 's night of doubts and haze <eol> for all these holy thoughts of peace , that spring <eol> from hearts at rest from daytime cares and pains <eol> are messengers of love , sent from the king <eol> that in the blessed country lives and reigns <eol> and from its gates , above the starry heaven <eol> come mystic rays that round our pathway stray <eol> his guiding lights that to our souls are given <eol> foretastes that cheer and brighten all our way <eol>
