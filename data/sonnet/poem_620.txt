i know , indeed , that sons of thine have died <eol> in lissa 's waters , by the mountain side <eol> of aspromonte , on novara 's plain <eol> nor have thy children died for thee in vain <eol> and yet , methinks , thou hast not drunk this wine <eol> from grapes new crushed of liberty divine <eol> thou hast not followed that immortal star <eol> which leads the people forth to deeds of war <eol> weary of life , thou liest in silent sleep <eol> as one who marks the lengthening shadows creep <eol> careless of all the hurrying hours that run <eol> mourning some day of glory , for the sun <eol> of freedom hath not shewn to thee his face <eol> and thou hast caught no flambeau in the race <eol>
