“ i do beseech thee , god , show me thy face <eol> “ come up to me in sinai on the morn <eol> thou shalt behold as much as may be borne <eol> and moses on a rock stood lone in space <eol> from sinai 's top , the vaporous , thunderous place <eol> god passed in clouds , an earthly garment worn <eol> to hide , and thus reveal . in love , not scorn <eol> he put him in a cleft in the rock 's base <eol> covered him with his hand , his eyes to screen <eol> then passed , and showed his back through mists of years <eol> ah , moses ! had he turned , and hadst thou seen <eol> the pale face crowned with thorns , baptized with tears <eol> the eyes of the true man , by men belied <eol> thou hadst beheld god 's face , and straightway died <eol>
