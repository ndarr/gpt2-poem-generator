i had no thought of violets of late <eol> the wild , shy kind that spring beneath your feet <eol> in wistful april days , when lovers mate <eol> and wander through the fields in raptures sweet <eol> the thought of violets meant florists ’ shops <eol> and bows and pins , and perfumed papers fine <eol> and garish lights , and mincing little fops <eol> and cabarets and songs , and deadening wine <eol> so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed <eol> i had forgot wide fields , and clear brown streams <eol> the perfect loveliness that god has made <eol> wild violets shy and heaven mounting dreams <eol> and now — unwittingly , you 've made me dream <eol> of violets , and my soul 's forgotten gleam <eol>
