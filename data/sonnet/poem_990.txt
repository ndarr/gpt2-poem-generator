i could not think of thee as piec è d rot <eol> yet such thou wert , for thou hadst been long dead <eol> yet thou liv ’ dst entire in my seeing thought <eol> and what thou wert in me had never fled <eol> nay , i had fixed the moments of thy beauty <eol> thy ebbing smile , thy kiss ’ s readiness <eol> and memory had taught my heart the duty <eol> to know thee ever at that deathlessness <eol> but when i came where thou wert laid , and saw <eol> the natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame <eol> and the encroaching grass , with casual flaw <eol> framing the stone to age where was thy name <eol> i knew not how to feel , nor what to be <eol> towards thy fate ’ s material secrecy <eol>
