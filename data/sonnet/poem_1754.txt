peace , the soul 's slumber , was round me shed <eol> the sleep where thought lives , but its pain is dead <eol> and my musings led me , a spirit band <eol> through the wide realms of their native land <eol> till i stood by the couch of the mighty dying <eol> a lonely shore in the midnight lying <eol> he lay as if he had laid him to sleep <eol> and the stars above him their watch did keep <eol> and the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh <eol> the homeless wanderer of the sky <eol> was the only attendant whose gentle breath <eol> soothed him yet on the couch of death <eol> and the dying waves of the heedless sea <eol> fell at his feet most listlessly <eol>
